very often i am and then sometimes am not and when i catch myself realizing that i have reverted back into being earthly mate i
to a family that would use that eventually want of using me as a work
less sold this black family who had two tiny children you
i am i know people don't believe it when i say i don't know how old i am but i really i know somewhere on my way pests
only as if where we passed fifty but i was really still about five six
she took a drag and there were times when the whole family was gone into the fields or something like that harvesting picking cotton whatever they were doing and we were left in the house alone the two teamators would tie me in but we call a croquesac
wasting and tying it to a tree and with a peach tree switch they would beat my bottom until i was bleeding and i only had one thing to wear and that was also made of potatoes
you it's that talking about it like we are talking about it now and you try to not getting most well about it but all of a sudden those feedings do
a idea of them tying me to a dream you know not even
strict my aunt was in a very tally
and also very fair in complexions have cherokee very majestic looking i was deathly afraid of her
duty no because she got a letter from the south that told her that if i was not taken away from this family that they would either starve me to death or beat me to death
and therefore she decided that she would take me on into new york but she wasn't any better she
i was trying to get away from her but where do you go what you do i
and whenever i had a few pennies i could beneath it was in some way was a nickel for
do the other hoping lets the conductor wouldn't see me because they used to have conduct
everything you possibly could i could possibly find a hide behind because i never have been with that kind of security within earth a mill that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted i don't think of it in myself for my subconscious and when i'm writing the book when i was writing the book i
the urchin that i really know i am in sight of myself and not wearing in a make up and not caring about what i look like
ugly nobody wants you and she's trying so hard to find somebody but scissors or right you wanted to but nobody's done that yet maybe i had maybe i had nobody wanted to but nobody's done that yet maybe i had maybe i had nobody wants you nobody wants you and she's trying nobody wants you and nobody wants you and she's you and she'll doclin nobody wants you and she's you and she's you and she's trying nobody wants you and she's you and she's trys trys you and she's trying nobody wants trys you and she's you and she's trying nobody wants you and she's you and she's you and she's trys it and she's it and she's trying nobody wants you and she's trying so and she's
ever touched me it was a horse and wells ruby rosa and there were
real love strong love that men have had for me two of them john barry ryan third and
particularly with boys who come from extremely wealthy families and they are the only son
everybody knows i'm past fifty whatever the number may be does not seem to matter to them
no matter how hard you tried not to it's still there i'm not a
i'm very glad that she still parted me and i'm very glad that she will always be a part of me
she helps me do what she knows i have to do but they're on the stage because there is when my survival is with that public and with those whom who know me well enough to rear
except at the part because something is in you that says you are of that character and if you have a little bit of a difficult time finding it you will find any entry may take you
in order to find the character but you will but that character to me was so
as physical a huge as he was and not having to one at that time of
still and to work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the manner in
but he was very scary and at the same at the same time it was very excited
was four of the three of them and me who had taken me to lunch at the
mc cluckins had concealed himself carolina and as a result you do what you are told to do not what you want to do
and i think that i was afraid always to exercise my feelings about anything because i thought i thought i thought i thought i thought i thought i thought i thought i thought i'd always to exercise my feelings about anything because i was afraid i was too exercised i think that i think that i was afraid i was afraid i was always to always to exercise my feeling that i think that i think that i was afraid i was afraid i was afraid i was afraid i was afraid i was afraid i was afraid i was always to always to always to exercise my exercise my exercise my first to exercise my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feelings my feeling
know anything about taking care of children my mother had died or who never was that was saying that she was my mother who had given me away to so many people at the time down south so she brought me up north my aunt
no it's not for me i'm a catherine don't a dancer and miss donnam has sent me out to get this maker
instinctively using that animal instincts that i had when i was a child in the south because been given away you know you have to rely on whatever's
and life has been so much fun for me but to be able to do that to make fun
of it because i can tease myself i can play with my mind
taking me as a something that is insulting them but cat woman to me was really one of the best things i have ever done
and i don't think that when people are i cannot talk for other actors but when i am called on to do a
because the i'm a human being of an american citizen i haven't a love this country and an american citizen is unhappy to love this country and an an an american citizen is unhappy to love this country and because because the i'm a human being i'm an american citizen is unhappy to love this country because because the i'm a human being a human being i'm an american citizen of american citizen is an american citizen is an american citizen is an american citizen i happened to love this country
back to america and that's when we had this tremendous discussion all the time as a matter of fact the black panther
that they would get me again but i stood my ground and walked from the seventh avenue teresa hotel
to all by myself back to the apollo cedar as
and although many how many words they threw at me i stood my grounds and no
said why is there so much juvenile delinquency in
and vers different areas of the united states among the young people i still have an organization in watscock
will we bring the young people in to teach them physical therapies of the dance form et cetera sarahm ah as well as other things but this luncheon was with us fifty women who were to discuss a problem
when the time came i rose raised my hand and told missus johnson what the young boys of this country had told
us to be involved there it was a dishonorable one was an unwintable war so when i raised my hand and told missus johnson what those boys had told
seems that within two hours i was out of work in due non estates according to
because i believe that if you get an education you can cross
you have that freedom of him of speech written
and as i said we in our country and solve our own problems on our own home grown grown grown grown grown growing and solve our own problems on our own home grown grown grown grown grown grown grown country and solve our own problem as i said we in our country and as i said do we in our country and as i said do we in our country and our country and as i said do we in our country and our country and our country and as i said we in our country and our country and our country and as i said we in our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country country country country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country and our country country and our country and our country and
and therefore what we feel in our own country should
ambassador hotelin was angeles and i call the
go over the contract to see that everything was so insurance so and they said
came to my house in beverly hills and asked me if i would do selina long
the number five character she is not not the one two three or four but i never worried about whether you are
we live in a free democratic world and unless we are exercising those freedoms
this is what this country is all about speak out i am due on to others as you would have them
did for the world and that's one of the reason why i wrote this book now that's outcor rejuvenated it's never too late because those of us who have come
to us and the value of that life and if we didn't do that we were absolutely out of our minds and
you can break through all barriers once you have that education but go for what you've really
you go for what you really love and what you really want to do you do better john bennett and money will always come and make you comfortable
what is now becoming more focussed into the realization of the black people that they too must become and behave and exercise their integral part of
i think that somebody who should be running this country should be somebody who knows how to be a business person who realizes that a business should be run
as i was at a deficit and the people of the country are constantly being forced into paying off the debts of a politicians whom we
and it's about time that we realize that like it says
will stand the chance of the possibility of becoming president of the united
to be in that position they have to know about how to take their own business they have to know how to
who's on the blacks or the italians of whatever why are you to be concerned about america i thought
i don't want any favours as a put o person of color i'm sure that the japanese'll do i don't know whether the germanese is nearly what i never
so interesting to me that every time i leave this country and i come back i find i feel more like a foreigner in my own country than i did from the
taking over very subtlely that like the man side won't have the need gone to take over america we will just walk in and this
yes everywhere and i keep my eyes open all the time and you talk to people of the countries whom you can get free
knowledge from not from politician or going to get anything for politicians but at their very cold and cold diplomatic but the people the real people that's why i take my chances in going to foreign countries and talking to the
then they were a more apt to tell you the truth but why aren't they giving away this land everything has so seemingly his dealing was what the bible says the religion says this piece of
to us and there is an always a bottom line of religious isumer that says we have the right to this land god
america so would i could i go to the government and say i want my land back
plaza hotel when i was singing one night and they were like twenty seats empty directly in front of me and they came in all of them because they were saving
these were other kings agakon's family and i stopped the show and waited until each one of them sat down and they had all of this jewels on because it was one of those people not the the aga but one
of members of his family of own mentioned the name he had that he would tie your models and then he would go to instance or cartier and tiffany
and so i waited until he thought they were all seated and calmed on then they had their little coffee and
that and then i said to him in turkish particular room and he said it soon he looked at me and at the end of the
i don't really think i'm looking for any the especial except maybe a good partner because i'm a dirt person i
i know that if i have a piece of land i will never go hungry because i know very much of you
if someone gave it me but it's more than that act will be your hawked for a piece
no lesser than but when i came out of the south into new york been brought there by my aunt who took me out of
that my mother gave me to this family who was it not very nice to me because i'm not the right color to be accepted by the black
to be accepted by the whites and your own papa little bet is a best of child
and i know but he wants you but if you'll give it away then that family or whom have you given away too uses you as a work mule and of course if there was food i got it if there was no food that i was the last one to be fed so between the animals the cats and the dogs and myself
so i learned how to survive from the forest and from the dirt my aunt brought me from me from the fire from the forest and from the dirt my aunt brought me from me from from me from the forest and from the dirt my aunt brought me for i learned how to survive from the forest and from the dirt so i learned how to survive from the forest and from the dirt so i learned how to survive from the forest and from the forest and from the dirt
the garbage cans and sleeping on the subways until i found the way into the catherine done uncomfortably by having an idea
and when i asked him what is the character about what kind of person i am how old a woman is she and he said you are all women you represent all women of all
and that's why i chose you to do this parties you're the most exciting creature i've ever ever ever ever ever been this parties you're the most exciting creature i've ever ever ever ever ever ever known this why i chose you to do this parties and that's why i chose you to do this parties and that's and that's why i chose you to do that's why i chose you to do this why i chose you to do this parties and that's and that's why i chose you to do this parties and that's and that's and that's why i chose you to do this why i chose you to do this why i chose you to do this why i chose you to do this fart to do this why i chose you to do this fart you to do this fart you to do this fard that's you to do this why
years i began to understand what he meant because i began to understand what he meant because because
from my side that he felt above me and to me an exciting person is knowing one of the
things about an exciting person to me is knowing when to say something and will not do say something and if you have something to say and you don't know how to say it then the best thing to do is to be quiet
and though he said it was very exciting from the artist's sewing
beak next gordon after i was a flopp at levyoro's next gordon who owned the blue angel called anna

who am a constance lady who were thieves et cetera et cetera and that's why i'm saying to you skip i bought their goodness i bought remistate because that i know how to survive on but you never know
from one moment to the other it depends on what you do with your life which becomes the most valuable thing and what you've done with your life for me i feel there's always another tomorrow
well i'm not saying yes and now i don't know what happens to morrow but i don't have any man in my life
wanted the mothers became the most domineering situation that cut off the relationships and the ones that i thought
and of him and his people to advise him to go that because i think it's about time also that true different
cultures too many races too many groups too many of their system any that's
leaving the company i didn't have enough cuthbert on my own to do that at the time but when miss dunnam forced me to by saying i dare

the cabarets can't fall back and it's true the cabarets had to close up because
they couldn't find people as paul saw them in her own plaza hotel once in a
every step on the way and i do realize that i have to make myself to them every step
of it i think that when i started to sing songs like that it was arasier who pushed those
the mechanisms behind the discose because we do not
and i came across the letter that jack anderson wrote me said these are your files that we found
quickly requested by lady bird and president johnson
the united states so that i would be not seen and therefore a
my opinions about the problems among the young people of america at that time that was the question of the luncheon and fifty of us ladies who work in the different communities across america and me and so also
indians unworken with these people all the time and therefore i know what their feelings are and when they ask the question about
if my getting a good credit for putting flowers a looking round sixty say
place that i can remember they did not have a return engagement and when i was not asked
maybe my popularity is waning and so forbidd does happen and i started to begin to rear
called me in nineteen seventy four january and said this is what we found
anywhere and that therefore you're that's my your having a part time
or they were claiming that they were communists or something like this and when they couldn't find anything on
and make you a very unpopular name in the eye of the public and in the minds of the public and not
that's still doing it if they want to get rid of you they'll find a way to get rid of you and the best way to do it is to
worked with just as they did with the anti american committee i was shocked when i came back to america in my
this kind of thing has happened to us we thought a war against things like this with the
something i still can't believe it and you never know if it is still going on because my side of the story was never really told what was i going to do apollo
wanted me to do that and i said i think they should apologize the american people because they know we should not be involved in that war and
and i don't understand how some one like this the man who had the fate of the young boys of this country in the palm of his
very but morally whatever it is we not suppose we shouldn't be
lost as job which i lost my job i still did it i didn't know i were going to lose my
in american cities and i happen to love this country and i know that we have our struggles
wells because being as physical huge as he was work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the manner in

general forms yes you've got a separate religion and state and
using terrors with religion would have less at the culture to grow

cooler people the people certain men of education they can dig serene humor and it's just the references of the snow throughout my theory as there is no french sense of him there is no german sense of humane
i just think there is main stream and alternative said sir humours in every country so much of benny hillsom like a main stream british said to humor but he made all his references you know people's slapping on heads naked people running around and poop could understand that in quite another country so there you go and then that the more pithing is the example of more turnative she must do just make your brother country so they just make your relative so there you's think there you go and then that you go and then as maine

ah if it was a funny scrip i mean i didn't think they were going to do a fourth one yet when they did the fourth when i heard about it i was on an addition and some one sets me home and they're making another american pie and i was like no they're not cause
go on i can't play sockered all but the weirdest thing is like anyone could put anything on wick
going into the children was at home regard to show as so great a one was really excited about it it would you know it's a really unique land of comedy in action and procedurel a
you know cyrilised romance stories and we were excited that we had something special but just like you said there's so much so much so much so much
i kind of head had been earlier in my career i played a lot of like the best friend
that the goofy neighbor ah the notes i was playing a lot of characters were cut off along the same lines as joey from friends and i was trying to make a transition into more leading man character a type rolls and a m and so i was going through a
of a a dry spell in my career i hadn't worked for
it took a little while for me to convince the business that i i could play something other than what i had been playing so when i when i walked into the task at where i was thirteen
i needed a job i wanted a job i had just had the my second baby my second son had just been born like two weeks before that and am you know i was i was staring the reality of not having a job or any money you know squarely in the face so i'm
others two of each character when we walked in there was like seven or eight seven or eight micas and seven or eight p
you just come to go of they have no idea what they want we're just the number here and my chance of getting this job
micas and the peats and going back and forth and going back and forth end em and nikinna was
it seemed to me that you could cut a towel least i could tell who was who they were paying attention to and then the guide that went in right before me the director came out
come here and he put his up he put his arm around this dining walk down the hall with the sky and i was like
with the regitated worm and give up the worm and i and i got no worm man i've got
worm to give and i was actually saying that at last
it's its probably the worst part of being an actor other than not being able
cried geffer and i'm like ah no not so kay but then he goes hey krag there's a diver here looks just like you and so that kred chefer comes
be somebody will look like me some day cause we got this new show where
is normally like eyes wear over overalls fairly like the pot
and into your pant pockets so there's no real pockets in the over
and who wants to ah who wants to hang around for waiting for you
ah the show every week is cut of a many moving above it's not too seriousized so if you miss it up so do you won't get completely lost
and ah what's for me what's great about the shows i've a couple of
voice and i'm the show doesn't talk down to the
and they adults can both watch at the same time and both find something it interests them and something that they can relate to it all reminds me of it reminds me of the old days when that used to have the wall dismal on sunday night the drizzney movies on suns
whole family would sit around and watch like you know when kirk russell did the world's strongest man stop like that
it's it's useless we don't take ourselves too seriously but at the same time there's some great drama it's a et cetera except for dusar calls it a thrilleromity
her and i and that's why i think people should wash it because i think everybody can relate to it
the artifacts in the warehouse are really just plot devices to get us to what the really show is that its
and fifty per cent of veno veer's ship rice i fischa
time high guy's hum yah mean any time someone has enough interest to fly you across the ocean and a come to meet the fans warehouse thirteen i say i'm doing something right so yam haven't
i'm a mindastralia i've been here out to thee cave you times ah to the emsia mixed
ah i've got over to paris if he times to do not a not a cons but to do press and i'm so i've been around you know but that
well others are there's a con called dragon khan in it lena where there's general
five or six o'clocks with no with bungless chaps on so any time you can see in o'hara with bunlas chaps i say that's a good time like that i say that's a good time like that
chaps here but if there had been some i would have had
you know we can always roll our eyes at what's your favourite art of fact or what's your favorite epis
a no i don't mind a a my favorite artifice sir abraham lincoln's hat because pete put it on and had an irresistible urge to free missus frederick sir that that that was pretty fine
i thought that was a really good just a good episode for the show i'm if you remember it's part of the two part finally from season three i'll wear
it may me i feel a lot of pride for the shows
i mean the reason i like the show i'm is that a it has
else you know it has action that his horror has
it has er roma i mean it's it's all it's all the john ross kind of wrapped up in one and
the kids can watch it too you know it doesn't it doesn't talk down to kids but still the adults can watch
you know pete's been sobered for thirteen years i've also i am also sober thirteen years that's like that's a good one i love comic books
i was never a marine i was never marine but i but i have a great deal of respect for anybody who
but ah but yet i think there's there's a ton of myself in that
i don't know a loose cannon that was supposed to be there but ah the funny stuff
you know he sees one of the funniest thing he's one of the funniest smartest guise on the planet that i've ever met so i think the success of the show is
ah because of him and because of the sapphire's willingness to let him do what he wants to do on the shelves
and i i'm actually kind of improduction with george a remero i'm we just finished a a scrip that worked there were trying to get made for a new dead movie called rhoda the
i'm it's basically about i'm humans have now exploited zobies because that's where we do as humans we
we exploit everything and a we've taken the zomos and we've used them for our own entertainment we've taught them to drive in kind of a m death race where we we watch them read we die

it was believed to her each dwells believed that people were more likely to believe that a man or that a man had written those stories than a woman so she used a man's face her brothers as as her and rose aged you wells
live as a soldiers and train them and then
tollingerton i mean that's to me what it's all out so to be able to do some like that would be here
no we haven't we haven't gotten the official green life from sapphire and season three but i mean it's pretty much
that i thought for mes would be my favourite is i'm to have jannis jopplin's back stage past from woodstock and whoever holds that a back stage pass can travel through time to any concert that has ever been that they want to go to sea you know leads upland
needles the doors black sabbaths c s r the band the yard bird
my a favourite music that i grew up on that my dad exposed me
nowhere but now i understand but how understand why you
his new show written by harthandson who created bones and that'll be on in november and that other night
fever i was schemed my family and my managers like this is row on cashing
met my wife before she was my wife i met this girl and she was
not i know you you wrote about me wrote that on twittery so nothing
the way to give back to them and all meanwhile people look out of their like wood in a
come here they say they mighty they spread their money as they want to find money on the things
just be a guy and ash a normal guide like when i when i
for the english lot addition i i just played it as myself because if i got the job i just have to go to work and be myself
one of them being that hit everybody can watch the show yes not just
but ah yah am he i like so and like de
cups and roses around there but ah we would we certainly love each other and
i'm not the question that there comes up as people say you are you didn't do a second trilogy in a light i just finished this
i think we'd joe ready well at cheyenne and ere she you know this scrip was the first time we'd written together for quite few years i think so
i just tried thinking i guessed i was pretty like so five years since we were in hot feathers when we had the story idea on the hoff has pressed all in let two thousand seven
what it was it was at sidney epphor as we made a landing from wellington to sydney and i so had the idea on the plain and i was thinking about the script i had written when i was twenty one about ten ages on a pock roll which had never done anything with i didn't necessarily want to make that film now but i thought only there's something in them being adults and
ah you know there's rich potential in the eye in the themes that mean simon keep coming back to about perpetual adolescence and what if like there's one guide that really wants to do this puckeral again and the other four aren't that fast
you know forcibly regrets as though or hell breaks loose be out so i mentioned the idea to simon and then we immediately come a light saw of styed hashing out the story
but then when we came to write it that years later light it was it was good we'd both had a break with both another of other projects and it just damned suck came out very so fluidly because we'd had a lot anything
did them in the memory rollin didn't he any more hang over himself but i i er i'd yah done one when i was nineteen just where the original scrip came from which was a disaster and then in my late twentys or metwenties may be after space and before shorn me and simon nick ended up in my home town and we tried to do it again and that one even worth
so i think so then then it's that a really strike me that this was like a
apathetic sort of like attempt to recapture teen age
came from really and then the solve that the idea of the blue canna ink inside because when i was a kid and
you reminded me of scores though i wanted to make the actors all fill at them a back of school again
i didn't even tell that the empire in london layers so quiet that here's the phase i get very superstitious about lakes or have took it about things before they're done because i
be the boy he cried wolf here and down you know talk about something if it doesn't you know i mean it it will happen you have better it's i for very jinksy talk
dressing you know based on the fact that the character is like grown up through this kind of pop culture and that he is like living as
day dream i sought to see the firmers like a big day dream as that scott pilgrim is like her
an orator who's in this kind of them you know so of perpetual adolescence and he hasn't really grown up here and there he's living his life through the media that he consumes and and what the film is about that the end is empty is about him kind of growing
so i will go into that he imagined his legs over it's it sir it's also selling i am worked on that for two years i have written this film stolidly for tears are the loss on which she did any work or end
eight weeks before i stopped pilgrim and i wasn't arranging the sheep at all which was an enormous bummer because i basely allowed words on a film with speedy spirit of pitch accident and i was actually around to be on the set at all
about like touchy watch that will in in inaction but i'm in the case of that one i didn't try and graft my impassion out now and we just try to be true to hersia
you have to watch anything before the new one and i would have all three maybe to stand alone
brian forbes the step for the wives and a very brine forbes notice heavy fast
i'd like to think the means simon and dick would work together again i mean
it was six years of half hours and damnment you know we really am
so did everything else away said it would make this one and his damned before his too late it's i'm ready to
just these incredible vocal warm ups took before take which is something the witness says quite so
d'artagnan i am i actually this quite refuse on me things i have not seen
books comics films games ah there's a some part of me that can have felt like i'd saw
a king might win because i'm not sure that he finds highly fair and maybe nicholas
is amazing and finds any his great end ah i tell you they really
we wheels knew as can be something slightly different and brian at she was involved in writing the final scene we had moved
voldemar and he was very so happy with the idea that he would diverge
because scotland like touched on a number as generals by action comedy romans fansis
my action it was always here to be a slightly harder cell and i think you know
i think it wasn't because it wasn't completely generic like sometimes people just one like how
no idea what that is so i think it's just down so if you're trying to do something so indifferent you just got a work why she's hard
and it was a tough film to counterlice all he explained to her acting as a
but that at the on the flip side of it lies frank crown of the navy
whenever and dumb but we all very proud of this shell
and we just had so faith in it and then it eventually found its audience and be we thee so i saw of when you come into the safety on sculpella my eye i just had yourself had faith in and i'd made and then he would get out there and i filled
films that a massive mass of pits cannot light do there after once to saint amar and then never gets in on the banks whenever again or never never be in one's
even ever again and what's really nice if this bewildering light somewhere in the world is playing like a
you know like the prince charles showed all the time and liked beneath beverly and los angeles and i like that i think that god makes me very happy that people are still saying with a crowd you know i know so that it's
i think so of light eyething i ought to go all about my system and spoke to them i feel that and this might be controversed to say it may be done conjoins with what awoke off is the man's head to plead it but there is never been a good idea against them and i think the wheat so far and the weeder for that is as it's just like that
standing you in the face is that villiers game is like a sort of a unique experience to you you are playing the game and just like watching something
my answer is there is no game i would like to judge maybe rampage
being certainly impassioned about light souls what the hair
first now and then i was very different to timburn's bad marriage and i gave him to adam west that man and this roomful free
no i don't really read too much other stuff against in my way
for some reason i read this one and i could see stray away why they'd given it to me as she i think i've read the first book country hospital hadn't come out yet she think about that
he was just off shore of the dead and damn and just really if anything as she reminded me about space
you know so it was the chance to hot thousands show on the dead even though they have really ridiculous things in them they both take place in a real world where that people die and are come back and
interesting to me because it's both highly relatable like it takes place
in you know it's essentially about a bunch of people in their teenson early twenty
but it are its philosophers that a magical filter in a world where anything
i think he was pretty instinctive i don't know what a straight aversion had stopped pilgrim visits the wood would be but he was so of asked me am i come you know how far as too far as the king i didn't really know how to soft pedalify him like this i think it's especially needed the self material and you know any one what it's about in the tone of it just it just it felt like it was
you know i licence to let my imagination run riot over it i guess what's kind of late that's fun and fresh about it like him so i'm
when people have asked me that i could ponder the thinking i don't know what a straight version of scotland would be the whole the whole kind of the vete of the whole
raisin debtor of the whole pieces of the york essentially seeing the film that's playing in scotland's head and that scotland was a character in his early twenty two has grown up on sadly morning carter
and comic books and villiers games and probably too much sugary product and your watching kind of like how he would like to live in the living and your watching kind of like how he would like to live in the livy books and villiers games and probably to comet books and villiers games and probably to comic books and villier books and villier games and previer games and properly to my books and probably to my books and premix and premix and premix and premix and prettier games and previer games and proper books and proper books and previer games and proper books and proper books and previer games and probably to
yeah no better miko i tephany was that kid at school i like i when i was at school comprehensive i was short sighted i don't know i was short sent to those twenty and as such i would frequently look at at the window like its inn classes because i conceived that bore properly and
and dudling kind of like rock bands not unlike sex oblong on my school book even like the look of such a one when they're playing and they have out lightly bolts and jagged lines coming out you know i would describe it to the enemies that it should look like a fourteen year old idea of a rock band and so
ynar sculpture was a couch was twenty two but sometimes he acts like a twelve year old and i can definite ampathise with him
was around so at the stopping of his inches and characteristics lay his kit quite floored hero he got the feeling that he can have been in a manner he's kit clawed floored hero he got the feeling that he can have done it
he would get distracted by a line or a barito as much as he were the next can of gorgeous girl that walks
yes and no it was a pretty organic process a mean we had a structure worked out as far back as two thousand
new material as it can it came together bryan went me first i write we had three books and
rebooks and then it kept developing ripe till shooting so even the six books we knew how as can end then we even
you know that reflected less and with a final solve the passages of them a book six so it's been of the a good organic process that returns that we watch and tanned em there were times when brian took some lines out the screen claim for them in the books which was very so pleasing in us that as a couple of lines in four or five that come from our screen play
lately that will be did like the well denies of israel puddleman fed ever as light several in the decay as one in particular the means simony
nothing at the world's end on me with the world's end so one me rather
to illustrate what was happening in each one so let me want in them to feel that terror cards is like the name of tellers
slight and with a visual medium right off you know if you'll light lov'nits the ground you must well be at the theatre
is literally represented kind of like that most weapons he is like this of light
i'm absolutely like i think so with this it was deftly like so because it was the combination of like am surely not far as the true john reforms we were
you know of my manuscript didn't that feature that it's whole so like it wasn't like it is not proper for me you know like a
i am he would want the audience to see as the journalist say which is told so why would ye want us port of
a thing is a nothing is to say it's pretty obvious as though you wanted he would see it lay
lights of juvenile answered so it was a silver film of that about regression and about the perils of lightness dowager and light how it's dangerous to go backwards and lay how you can never go home again so we thought like nina we'd both been simon a frog like small towns that came to london so have we go back into a strange and sometimes with a sweet experience and we thought that was a very kind of light i parry five perry five perry five perry five perry five perry five perry five per cent five per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent a five five per cent a five per cent a five per cent a five per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent a five
absolutely no i would never rule anything out it's stiffly young i don't add a white people would think it was a good bye sir the euchariad fetched i know i had a glass making this room and it was
as i am really started on that so i don't have a lot who have discussed
and even to the point where there is the big tan of the astonished face off between two bands
is in like seventy thousand eight and i asked nigel gordritch to get involved in the fifth of the fifth
the first score is ever done but prior to that way before then eighteen months before we start to get the artist together to portray the different band
he would sell him the firm wasn't dandy then so he did the hotel number cornelius who am a huge fellow
his sex boulogne playing was designed in the touchings to be a lot shorter the tussocks was really sure and then we actually expended the taxi
the at the evening song changed one of the soldiers can be on the anchore des nigel so said ah he can't say that some of the anchorets surely that should be the one
you're shooting i think in this house great yet i wish it so that you went far away from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the soul away from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the soul in the soul sowing the way from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the soul your shooting and thinking of thinking of thinking of thinking this has great yet this has great yet great yet it may beshid you are shooting and it thinking of thinking of thinking i think in this has great yet in this has great yet great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great in this has great yet great in this has great in this has great yet great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great yet great yet great yet it is great yet it is great yet it is great in this has great yet it is great in this has great in this has
it feels in that respect you know destacteville as like a more lucky seventy former in france
this one it was something where the general like like a lord cypher movies as the tsouvre the general came out of like a manifestation of the fear in a way and the movie is about and people returning to that home town and realizing that the time is marched on without them and simon's character is a man who wants to be eighteen again so like the cut of the
the aliens in the movie essentially represent the kind of that fear of change and that loss of identity so this saw the things came together it is as she like a literally light whenever is thy comb in my midstwenties when i saw you stick her back to my home town every light colour that holidays like our
i would er like so you know get increasingly kind of like so of a the mease by the fat like oh let nobody remembers me let none of the bartenders remember me the school bully doesn't remember me it's like ice it's not so much that i never left it's like i was never here and i remember saying to a friend of mine like way that i said i've got my go back to my aunt hannah feels like in vision the bread at the bread of the bread of the bread of the bread in fresh of the bread of the bread of the bread in fresh of the bread in fresh of the bread at the bread of the bread of the bread of the bread of the bread at the bread at the bread of the bread at the bread at the bread at the bread of the bread of the bread at the bread of the bread of the bread at the bread at the bread and fresh of the bread at the
so lay little i does like that like stick is lying a cake you can never go home again you feel any
a big reason and in the movie like sort of light so all these things all came together as that we wanted to do a movie about kind of like
at the dangers of miss dowder and a like a man trying to turn back a clock and you know but then even that the thing of luck at home coming is the soul of life
act of it is as much a coping stratagee for me and simon as it is for garrick king is that light he is almost it is a sin to move where he finds out that like something's afoot and he's happy when he's talking of it is as much a coping stratagee for me when he's a bit is as much a coping stratagee for it is as much of it is as much a coping stratagee for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me and simon is as much of it is as much of it is as much of it is as much a coping stratagee for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for me for
he's kin accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older light the
he's not as big a legend as he thinks he is and the town wasn't all he was cracked out to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was some fact this is the story which is like so often that the sapphire is a manifest day
something's afoot and he's happy when he's talking about him and the reason he's happy is he's
he's kin accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older light the
he's not as big a legend as he thinks he is and the town wasn't all he was cracked out to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was some fact this is the
but curious like a satire as if we drew a very sharp light in the sand of the antecedure as if we drew a very sharp light in the sand of the antecedent of the antecedentas at ours if we drew a very sharp line at the sand of the sand of the saffrons if we drew a very sharp light in the coast like atosss
with the drug humans you only have one showing her there is no real grounder in a submit then lettered what the movie is about like his is the
you know it like the art that our hero like simon's captain is extremely floored and is like makes a law bad decisions and dozen terrible things you know liken that he's very questionable like in his motives a long time and yet when it comes down to it is that what makes his human is like the fat that we are floored and made mistakes the key is learned from your mistakes so that we want it makes off likes or fills or fills or fills us off likes us up with a big or fills or fill a big or fill a big so of legs or fill a big so for the sticks or fills or fills or fills or fills or fills or fill us all fills or fills or fill us off like it out of legs or fills or fills or fill us up he does this cut a legs or fills or fills or fills us off
plans other than the we'd like to get together and like i think the thing is that sort of light and we're very proud that we did disturb movie and m is much as fans one as to do another one we wanted to do another one you know but the other thing is that this ought to do on a film
sub specific criteria for these movies is that they are all like jean valjean's though really like trojan horses fill a relationship of his am
but they're all about like perpetual adolescence a loss of identity the individuals of the collective they're all about growing unmarried density the individuals of the collective they're all about growing unvarying and they're all about like perpetual adolescence ay by their all about life perpetual ad lessons i they're all about like perpetual a bout like perpetual a lessons ah they're all about like perpetual a bow like perpetual a lessons a loud lessons a latime a lessons a loss of our all about like perpetual a lessons a loss of our all about like their all about light
its themes so as there means if we did and another from the garret we might do something
they're all three of them if you're far shorn and this one they all have endings that light
for life i found i liked the film a sore bassus film phase for which is a
and ab and his really spooky is coming like a mix
supermarked by lenses tis a really spooky film ghipifon is really great for telegraphy i wished on tea even as a little kid and then lise finally come back
a spanish director who only did one other film which is also a less
but it's a bow i'm a couple that goes to a spanish island i wear kids have taken over the kids don't say anything and it's come a sight it's like the birds with little kids and it's particularly like grim and spook
it was also known in the seventies island of the damned and d'ar both felt by that direct is thick both grey
there's really worth watching and it's by the same team that did
charity event in this village which think it taken over by terrorists so then the olympic
is so much fun born to fight i hardly recommend it i have been telling a hold of a prince of it as i would assure it to an audience because i wished on liberty and it's just
obscure but it was for quite a while quite difficult to get hold of is darya alexandrovna's fall flies on grey velvet which is a
and and then the title itself i pretty shouldn't tell you what the title refers to you that cannot give the way the way the lady should tell you what the title refers to but cannot give the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the way the end and and and and and and then the title itself i am and and and and then the title itself i am and and and then the title itself i am and
like a break warm after that basely so that a low bit more a little
in preparation for the hot fires called live like a cop dial like a man
and then there's the sacustic duo who is singing such a sappy
in this kind of them hippy wasteless and as one of those films it has like it has big dance numbers in it it's got so quiet a big budget but like amazing bizarre design the coriobrifer
and then years later i ranged him in the allay and he remembered me that he had to go nor can your friends have said you didn't tell me that the apple
i wonder if that will about the apple that's deafly worth watching it has an amazing ending where it looks like a ran out of money or something happened where just as it's getting to what should be its third act the film abruptly stops with an intervention by god literally like in one scene one of the captors says mister tops is coming and missus top sends that to be just to be just that to be just that to be just that to be juddging one of that all about the old about the all about the at all about the study
you would watch it if i think this is so cruel this is like a sovereignic of extreme prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim prim primper this is so cruel this is like herself a nick of extreme pre emit of extreme prelate that you would watch it you can think this is so cruel this is so cruel this is like her sovereign
serves the prank so e'er would say let sam people who watch your say are of this filmy so cruel and yet there are some amazingly funny bits in it it's different he can get only with e and i'll never sort the actually so that the defest of all was but cognitively he and its sound it's
i would i would reckon i would recommend it i would necessarily am condoned it i would never make the room
like his french from point blank and which i presume spoke sunday out of france
you can get on a beerfy and thee liddy and in such you short but it
and basely they all die horribly and when each one dies
as i go myself i didn't know what the tile of it was and mister tarling then much later i found it was called a patch eaves and is dressed by john mackenzie and it on am air a barefied daily called like stop looking less than one of those
a little known ninety ninth life on port of fiscal fingers it was directed by edgar howard wright ah he was twenty
you might look out for a young fresh face twenty yard acts would take the right who appears in one scene a little brief against your it also features a jeremy beetle are i pea true joan biddle is in the movie
i'd believe the director had to make it like i'm padded out to get to simply eight minutes
one thank you for not asking and at my question be it knows true i am developing a horror mivy it's funny cause people always ask me if i'm everging him do a film of don't and ay i wouldn't because i think you've already seen the funniest version of that m b i want to do a straight horn of me i have the side therefore alike i guess is like an english i can not dreamy and like an english i guess is like an english
go right and this is a hastily written list of my fate from the two thousand thirteen but where the disclaimer because it sir what the twenty six in november and there are a lot of awardi films that come at the last couple a month to yet i have not yet seen so this does not include the following films because i have
great films shorttime twelve with bree larsen whom i
gideon's blue jasmine i saw that twice and er and a man
favourite film of the year another film is quite deviceive but i love to is harmony current spring breakers which i
from the air which i have seen twice on the big screen and would plant to see a third time of the alphonse a transcribity which i think is extraordinary and i recommend
i must like to leave it either if it was like so of course if it ever actually was it like a very pleased with the end of somebody was that i
you know how to be doing twelve weeks with all the fight scenes and i said well you know that the trade off is that to get to shoot like a
happening we we weeded and we tried once we had what the scene was we tried to
ni and m i was sitting on the plain and idah a thing was a rather time that superb was about to come out and i was thinking about that film and er and the
i'm i see myself a garry cane a little bears well and i talk that i think so of like that we you've got a half sympathy for your characters because even though the character lighted the same place as like a sol walking car crash of a man yes he's still like he hits rope water but he still can arises up to be a hero that's a hero that's a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing you's that's that you'll go to come we don't a little kind of like i't we don't we don't we don't we don't well and we don't well and we don't well and we don't well and we don't right tis that we don't
two weeks ago so it still feels pretty fresh fresh to me so like
and so his funny one people watched any fellow they say so it's next i said when he eats what's the
we alleged me just finished it like you at least hold up says ike about three or four
so i am i feel i feel rather very nice in terms of life
fell and made me quite kind of like out emotional watches watching them in a way because
you know i think in a similar way to shore and it gets carnivora as well as it being like funny an action pack it gets a kind of a bit deeper emotionally sometimes and
friends who have a rift and i think a lucky will have that experience of life so of the people that you saw when you and nineteen you were getting to be best friends with for ever maybe you are not as close any more and it's really from about
well at the theme and nostalger in the movies i will see very strong it almost like its garry's worst enemy if anything that the villain of the piece in the movie is nostalgia because likes simon's character garry carey care
it is convinced that he wants to relive his ninety ninety glory days and it is a thing of that he should be careful what you wish for because when they do attempt to recreate it things go badly wrong and also
you know what the film is about is that so the difference between a your kind of light rose tinted likes off memory of the past and the reality of it and so and then it wants you add alkaline to the mix it comes like this kind of light time machine sending you back to maintain edges again so as definitely the whole film is like a a a a bit of a
in terms of let the other actors in it it was differently important to us that it wasn't so much about well this a couple of things you write that space is that the one person from space you hadn't been in any
we had written a roll for him in throwing the debtors then got cut out a eden cheated we just cut out the script half as he was spoke
and then we one is also make sure that the people who were in the first two movies at one end too that offered anne shawn would also be in this one so let's quite
i think as because i either up in a small town in england you know like wells in somerset where i grew up is very pretty
so as a result i feel like sort of light most of the films i've made have some larger form of escapeism in them in symptoms of in space is no different about like here's my monday
and this is different in the way instead of it that she saw avert like here with a start of the movie
recognize being like the soul of the most action packed night ever and then the irony is when he tries to recreate it it really become
it only comes to change you when it comes into marketing and stuff because i think if you had to cut together a trailer that said it was just about friends drinking the pab then i think a twentieth of the audience would
sir you have to at least hint that there's getting me some kind of larks of you know that like big scale kind of action and special effects to this lots of cut is lots of things that are in the trailer that we have come a kept to ourselves but you know you got up enough action and special affection to the trailers of people will
said i was orany he had to cut out a thicket we don't really either we cut a wen that we went for it i am i mainting i deafeny though why mean is the
here it makes it very kind of like her challenging to kind of try and make
as it is so i add i can feel that as a film found i sometimes i watch some summer films which you hear about the cost like two hundred million and you watch in gang where did he go when are they spending all on that one
and something and so you know i with this film i just take in i started to make sure
why simply would it's the same way that some girls don't like uncle q is that are you ready to care to hurry away that word it's the same way that some girls exclaimed are you so nice as i so well how would it be nice some one of the laying up down to be a tap at ten
some of that stuff is the wetter boys we can't we eat weaker than of them we works can have harder trying
make the pot in the character's work so some of the kind are snowy stuff and some of the references that save the kind of you know the crab with god with god's god and some of the references that say the kind of he know the crab with god with god with god with god in the character's work so some of the kind make the partners make the characters work so some of the characters make the cats
i was wondering if they had oped it in the much longer the end but am wednesday that that the all that suffers though is the the wizard of wetter can have put in tinted references to the corner of every frame i guess this or if there's a favourite one i think hergee draw an intense portrait right the stars
there was a thing that ly john hoebeager capitalist but then somebody pointed out a john hurt placed countless in the lungs along the lungs but then somebody pointed out a john hurt placed captainess and the lung along the lung along the lung that there was a thing that there was a thing that there was a thing that er like john hoebeaker countless but there was a thing that there was a thing that i was a thing that er like john hoe john hoeyer like john hoeuar like john hoegin hoebiger countygger countyr a capitalist but there was a capitalist but there was a capitalist but there was a capitalist but there was a capitalist but then somebody was a capitalist but then somebody was a capitalist but then somebody was a can's a thing that there was a thing that was a thing that there was a
er maybe it's like a pan to mine thompson i could be one of the thompsons that have like a man it connects me as another
where's mac card on that one direction of the biggest began to go down to earth and take over sit there

somberland to be playing often with different actors from different genes
in a week we have ridding up there the budget canon like bassa over this riffing and
the llama zexy called dolly lama and is actually owned by the director that anne and rider of
i remember a giant that happened to talk about how he takes risk and chances and haven't created character
this might work or might not you know you would blame me to play jack's barrel
huh when i didn't appoint on me at a plate painter's senses i i put busticaten a maxwell's dog together and at the occaiming it is my work but when i met john here as a napoleon
a choice that i made and and with the help and the providence of a director ah we
sometimes in films you see lot of the actors and they always play the same type of character but that's how that's who they really are and that's grow
it that's one too you know but i'm i read a lot i met home watching brandyfleet
in a from from from marlan brannel to borcomotabantrology in or even the actors of my generation it would watch heth ledger and he could watch his
and an pedro he's such a character that's logged by so many fans i ain't on and because it fills such a wonderful story you know i'm who're found this considered together an enjoy from coast to coast oh from a hull of the world actually and that's great you know i edison and my friend're picture from israel that there's a signs in both for pedial and it of lake a play painted on the o so many has pray painted on the way painted on the wall my face and at the wall my face and i don's play painted on the wall my face and at the wall my face and i think
so so even now after seven years when people approach me at people are nervous and scared and they want to hug me then i grunted your bedroom like oh my god yes sure i'd give him
it's i'm lucky to play a character that people love i suppose to plain the villain why don't we get in in any people love i suppose to plain the villain why don't we get in in a minute in a minute it's it's it's i'm lucky to play a character that people love i suppose i'm lucky to play a character that people love i's
yet i knew you you embraced that you are higher doing than i could hear what you real name and
the the animated series you get to explore not only napoleon and the world but every single character that's great because of napoleon and the world but every single character and that's great because it's great because the the animated series you get to explore not only napoleon and the animated series you get to explore not only the the animated series you get to explore not only napoleon and a serious juicy
a every episode you get to see different skills as the nepisa we see pedro and he's seeing us and plays the tar and i thought well or i they go kennedy to
on this ghost people can blow up the air and the world to go on fire
but because it's so packed and it's so flippant hot so i don't like
and it's a wanted guide to say pay joe and i got bombarded and swarmed i was cruel but it was his rear
oh and i got bombardants warm and was cruel with those who were
get a good old report so but a the security had a show of being had a poem at best to remain
still i'se used later any of em in their fans and his comicons so you can be barred no matter what
and as actors but when the movie group as it did were going
i would say that even after him you'd do a panel and we were sending igrass for for hours ah there was still a huge line and
for me being able to send as many argoths across the river wherever they wanted to cause her i'm there it's comic on this dire heart
grateful i've had to see that and because you're thinking quite smoothly came out seven years ago it's no effect that the woman we part of not only are we animated and the napoleon dynamited the animated series but it's part of animation animation domination you're going to work at hand
comicalen itself i remember john here haven't tucked about how he's as a panel he wouldn't walk the comicon and he got bavarted he'd bet that
esteem punk i know the eyes i was like day in the dead i've painted my face the people were bumping into me going to do the way punk which is
prince's convoyiver and i i just stop back for those people who are in those suits because
yah yah as matter fact i would like to see my character cross over to the simpsons and then over to
i did an absence of american that actually i played one of the girls of boyfronts so i am nea seth and the whole gang there i mean everybody even with the fox fat
so in i always worry about other studios because i know they want to get to the animations ah dominaced the cunning
i am a member of em and all the episodes ah and why think one of my favorites
i was in a mo t'other's two of em this thundercorn i wore where ye'd feed napoleon's fighting skills
i haven't got about that and then there's the other one where we've begun like a town where all the lie
if animals can talk ghosts can happen we will can blow up my head to blob and it took a
a starving starving artist's project where i see p m and he explained to me about what it was about and i wondered startled up and if reminded me of how i
if that could have died means the direct notice going he know i think plainly what he was stirring is the direction of his going he know i think plainly what he was staring at the stern the direct note that could have died means he's that could have died means he's that could have died means he'd have died means the direction of the direct notice going helket how to guide guide guide died means to guide means he's who the direction of the direction helse the direction of his guide how to guide how to guide tad's held how to guide means held how to guide means held how to guide means who was the directions who was the direction of the direction the direction the direction of his guide means who was the direction of the direction of his guide means who was the direction of his going to gon hel
if it had something else there it would give them some proper guidance to
i had i have some knowledge and with that knowledge i'd take on and move forward i'll inch my own endeavors but for somebody who's starting out whether you're a painter in musician or an actor a director or writer it wouldn't have due the arts a
that there are some there are people there you know that they care upon the
since he could be a lonely road and if we need somebody who can say it ought to keep doing it this piece of the right direction
to be tools to get you from twenty eight weeks ah so sir some like the sad
well maxim workin on a show called sponge down for h p o with a venomic pride in stephen little and a willfarrow so but i'm here actually to support the citizen i've been festival i got one of the films called a pencil
that's right to zect the right and there's actually of several other films that got a film from argentinetus miha a airing to night
and then there's several workshops as we're worked up that's been done by arline who's axing gray's anatomy i wish to talk about making a holly one and nom for those he gets who are really interesting being in the business i think it's a it's a great great deal great a great deal
he did not only hear from an actress but to hear her prospect of exublicits from this town or from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from to to to not only here from an actress but to hear her not only hear from an actress but to hear not only hear not only hear from an actress but to to hear her not only hear from an actress but to hear her only hear her only hear from an actress but to hear her only hear her only hear from an actress but to hear her own actress but to hear her prospectress but to hear her prospect from an actress but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her prospects but to hear her
the glam life and the hollywife you want talk about going the parties and mean directors but and that's great but the truth is it starts off ah in your college yourself it's touched up with community where you
the shortfounds too independent films and grow on to making big future films but ah that's a quality of work and i'll not be able to think about just tis writing something and throwing it in throwing it out of work and lot people think of watches tis writing something and throwing it into independent films and grow on to make short founds and to make short films and grow on to make new short films and to make a few make a few make and to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them go on to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them feel on to make them feel on to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them to make them feel on to make them to make them
i think it's its releasing down with great mentors who understand the business and understand the art and if you put those together and really creates on the great then it will be big i i could put my soul into that is a sort of
i write what and what my nervy take it on the fact i am truly a big man
and besides his carbunade and in many people of our generations to sit down and watch and enjoy
you just like the effect of words to you you would hope that any work you do will
just as if she's a person only actress you know she's an entertainer and this roll was tailored for her which he has to play
she says we are whole your house will be in private algie's towers when she hasn't any towels yet well what
a a i love you i married it and i said and i remember when he said i am nagging of a
nor i understand anything but his my reason when i was up on stage and wrapping
yon and then some of the berrys held out bad words and the strangers could not tell me
but he had my next boat twenty fourteen or thirty fourteen for the gutt's work that meant dick's
of running a mule at the times of his companions and then i met his guide with a dozen of the girls
not at all i hear had looked around to keep a service time
who did not mean to knock him like that of a local saying and
when he got any reads printed some it was i've been able to see them only the packs of papers and where you see what was it all and the bottle hands i'm for the teaching that was right through the hats miss mann
i guess if you vote for me all your wildest dreams of country and get a state with a a get a brazier raise it and one act
that's it but i'm no secret man i just like to keep it real and
this air with her nextronnavo called peg otherwise an understand i am when the two of them got together well they've just spent the whole lives together they've never really grown up they're just like heads really excited they do the same things they've always done they don't let the outside world in
they're just in their own ill world and completely unaware of anything else that's going on and it's a lot of energy to both of them i'm
you know if it's kept too early to hand she's always the one to bring them back to ain't i am cause pigs quick like as a vip more
mad than she is but he never gets to express that because she's always there to bring him back to kind of reality and away she's also a lot deeper than em like moore and touch with her feelings and
but he's just you know everything's just come of black and white and so it's gone a hard to talk about the characters separate because they're so close together gen'lery you have to talk about
kind of routine they play the same games they have these royal plays at the play the whole time
him we'll just like the games that kids will pay we like we pay that game again again yet or kay and they're into the game you know when you grow older that as you go as you go again yet or kay under into the game you know and you grow older that as you go out as you go ere m we'm we'm we just like the games that kids that kids that kidd will pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we like we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay you like we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay we'll pay you like we'll pay you like we'll pay you like we're like we're like we're like we're like we're
of their world like and they went when they get to the palace it's come to be amazing they
queen of their world i am so i think that ront knows she will get to the palace eventually
i just found it really strange for then after that i got into us and it just completely fell in over that i'd like i'm a complete succour for
there's a big difference to this one the base other airs a complete love story of story
it's it gets very dark and it gets really interesting in that way because
reflects a lot of relationships in the sense that you know when you first meet someone your relationship keeps grown and grown whatever relationship it is like especially like with a boy girl one and when you get past a certain stage if you are not prepared to keep change in with the relationship if one presses does the same you know to mean if they don't change to get changed against against a change and with the relationship if one process does the same if one presses does the same you never mean if they don's to gains to gains to gains to gains to gains to gains to gains
it's gone at ends when person might want with the other one doesn't and there happens all the time and
and is well because it's so intense and it is unhealthy because they haven't developed properly
she you can see her even when she's reading back over you know with the sides you know for dynasty and she's coming to think of maybe to add something else to him
you know to mean livinus and i don't think it's a matter of ages or matter of understanding us and
i don't know once whence he can feel the story like his a lot of people it would read it and just knock at it at all because of the way it's written and then like you need to see performed whereas other people
if he does come i'm ill intensity and i play lucy honey church in
lavish and she's quite m yet experimental i am as was a year lucy she comes from a family
john whitefield and she has him about to the island in that time so the only thing that pulls her that brings her back is her friendship for henry there's no way she's going to miss that wedding so that shows has stronger
i am so she has dirt to face a lot of a lot of past i am issues that she hasn't outward that she's coming run away from
and ere ten if they've got quite good attentions round what
i am unnatural to be honest i don't know what to expect i i think
leslie's eyes stood with anne you know entertained and
she should know exactly what's going on and where we are in the story
to just take each situation as it happens and when people are talking it's like i understand what's going on but lydia doesn't so just take oh oh don't i don't like when they talk of it all this visitors it confuses me anna reminds me
i'll say you know that he's pleased and that's as far as i'm concerned my jar my job is to please him because
angela robel otherwise known as galley m shees adolf's half niece cause her ma'am is his half
enough they walked into a restaurant in it ruin would stop and stare and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship and it was a lot of foreign a lot of excitement living with her famous uncle you know and coming from a poor family so she got
in time with that character so am i got to know gilly really well and every day you spent time with her i sang to her freaky brother so
just cushions so full of life and em it was just a real it was just like being or in sunshine every day it was just so refreshing to be ranger but then towards the end of felsemen and
we are quite difficult scenes to do m cannon myself and they got quite intense and for the first time ever oh i wanted to escape a character
i am you know ye're equal to sight read them and disguise
an easy scene i am there to be quite well worked but i am with neck the director who was absolutely brilliant and with canny just you know we'd blocked the scene and then because he's just so brilliant or just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
so slight and i s'pose you could just read it in a once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nicholas brilliant as he pin pointed malmanson's out we tried it a few different ways and so in each scene you just felt
should be international you know it went when some one has a story to tell i am it's universal generally and m it is interesting to think that your voice might be doves you know and and i i i've listened to it before when i was on a plain one's and there was a film that i i i i i've i've listened to it before when i was on a plain one's and there was a film that was a film that i
done then i got to hear myself in it a few different languages which was really impressive but then i realized i couldn't speak those languages so that was kind of i am good of a shame i could always learn the language but i take too long eh but yet no i think it's great that you know drama that's made he
why not let the world see us so to come to this event to show case the great drama that the b b c do has they been doing it a hell of a long time and m it's it's great that other countries have the opportunity to purchase it and then
as none as gully i am she's adolf's half niece cause her ma'am is his half
ruin would stop and stare and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship and it was a lot of foreign a lot of excitement living with her famous uncle you know and coming from a poor family so she got
in time with that character so am i got to know gilly really well and every day you spent time with her i sang to her freaky brother so
just push yourself full of life and m it was just a real it was just like being or in sunshine every day it was just so refreshing to be ranger but then towards the end of felsenburgh and we are quite difficult scenes to do m cannon myself and they got quite intense and for the first time ever i wanted to escape a character
i am you know ye he couldn't de site read them and disguise
easy scene i am there to be quite well worked but i am with neck the director who is absolutely brilliant and with canny just you know we'd block the scene and then because he's just so brilliant just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
so slight and i s'pose you could just read it in a once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nick was brilliant as he pin pointed malmans and out we tried it a few different ways and so in each scene you just fell like you were doing a work
tree a john whitefield went on a killing rampage and killed six people and her mamma was one of the six so her relationship with her dads
diminishes and he sends her to alais to her grandmother's and m she has a
try to to get on top of it all and she has run away from a lot of things yet the relationship of her dad she has been spoken to in all that time so i mean i think it's probably it is maybe
and how the characters interrupt and then how the events can have turned ice and had they reacted those events then that kind of came
we hear that swim them people can do pools and and decide who they think the killer is and am and why and amy the amount of conversations we had because
well i mean it it you know it depends i think different people will get different things from it and i think they throw a lot of things out there
the beginning to make you kind of confused astir to what's going on but m but yeah i mean you know we were just we'd get a scrap to them we'd be eager for the next one only like
i suppose it's most similar to reality shows in a dominion where it was originally and pitched as that and it's m and in the way it was sharp you know everything was
much better girl grandmother i mean about her mother i am the only kind of raw model of a woman that she has is a great grandmother so i think that's why she's a bed if that's why she saw naive and innocent in a bit kind of back
never kissed a boy and i can know her friends have what she hasn't and it's
because the only woman she has his two generations older than her look i am and she meets so when she meets johnny
it's a different story but em as though when he goes away she finds it she's pregnant for a month's later and tells her dad and her dad like he loves her somewhat but he just he's so annoyed touched in our wits against a religion and
oh that's so she can't feel such that she has to go and find johnnie to make everything okay and she goes over to bremenum to find em but it's harder than what she thinks she
cause she takes every one on base value also when she tells them that she's proud and
in our wishing that maybe her father had re acted like that instead so it's kind of luck she seen the bits of her father in em that her father father father liked she seen the bits of her father in em that her father father father father father father father father and i wish and that maybe her father had reacted in in in our wishing that maybe her father had reacted likedued it in a wishing that maybe her father had reacted like maybe her father had reacted likeed like that maybe her father had reacted like that maybe her father had reacted like that maybe her father had reacted like that
he's not bad to hurt you not a man he just has his way of bringing a rope but
so then i was going to get myself into the frame of mind of rickus she's quite different to me i am and
you know if we're if i had an idea i wanted to change you know to say
you know he'll listen it's not just like okay this the way we're gone and we're not changing for any one you know he'll he'll he'll completely open minded and he'll think about it and say o kay what ashy if he'd disagrees you'll be a right self truly easy to work with a man as well
he wants something more as i feel to say a few key words and then it gets you back on track kind of an he's he's really going
so it was created by written by starring executive produced by a directed sum wrote some of the music all by denis
play his love interest and his back upsing her imprecation
so he ought back in the day when this was happening there were a four of us living together three women and denis's characters johnny raw
sure and i'm then you know now present day he has a daughter show up that none of us knew he had and she wants to be famous and we're like you a writer
has money is that she has money yes and then it turns out she's actually over talents
venice is so he's such a sport about him really just the self deprecation
well he he describes it as he created the show based on some guise who didn't quite make it rajano and thought that that was sort of more interesting yes and that side of it so there are
in the show whose characters did make it you're then but he didn't so it's that i ought you're in a monday morning armchair
and even more than that i think it's relatable to any body who has a family of your any
namely as if you're a human you come from sums the almost disfunction you're and that's really what this show is about is to have one big disf
take it from somebody who got their mullers very early in life being in love is a fantastic mystery that takes some
and beautifuls not a crying you know and for your for one one i adore your father
to break it to you angel but you are no longer the only girl in dick parker's life
well i'm i'm on the host holiday for stars for stripes and i'm a big animal advocate so i'm right at home with this some i've worked with katy i'm
fur and then a documentary that she has in the works and then am i am on the board of several
good and i know that's not the most agreeable advertising sound bite here but i'm
it's katy's project and i don't know where things are you know with it i just know that i was one of several experts that she interviewed about i'm sort of animal rights and in what's happening with them in particularly with i'm spain
i am a brush a lot of pace i have a christmas movie coming out called i anything but christmas and then right after that i'll be i'm stopping his ex wife on his new show see dad run
but i'm my pet project no pipe or every pun intended really m i'm launching a new animal project called the pet matchmaker and we launch him january it's a multimate project it's a huge project so i'll be getting the word out of our facts
ah i think the best place right now is to come to me i'm twitter you lane for the number four animals and then my wet sided lane hundreds stop
and let me did denis say because denis and my character like were all about socks but he said
ah it's so excited for you to meet them i play ava i'm gyrox play by denis his long time girl ran him back up singer and we've had a wild wild ride together we've done everything seeing everything and then some and i'm and along the way i have stuck with him no matter how disfunctional he gets and it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love it's true love
it was pretty pickass and we were at like the irving palace sir a mirving place plaza irving plaza a m
along we can hurling plaza or the on or the apollo all these plays
family add a very disfunctional family but a family and mean let's face it if you are human you understand this function on some level i'm so i think there's can be something in there that everybody can relate to and you know it's
avas that's her thing she committed to the rockenwell life that's that's it's
through and through so should they are committed to each other now they've seen everything
and you're going to get to see that really she wanted a family all these years despite all the draught the drugs and the sex and the rock and roll i'm she wanted a family and now she gets to have that when johnny rock has a daughter who shows out that they never knew he had and then there's also a really fun in a spoiler or a knock on a give and i read it when i read it when i saw that when i saw the final episode that when i saw the final episode that when i saw the final episode when i saw the final i saw the final episode that when i saw the final episode that when i saw the final episode and that when i saw the scrinos she wanted it when i saw the scraped it when i saw the spoiler i saw the scrap of it when i saw the scrap it when i saw the scrap of it when i saw the scrap of it when i saw
tracks but then once we got going the guys a john corbett arty knew how to play the guitar john ales who plays base he learned how to play the base and then robert kelly who plays drums he learned how to play the drums so by the end of our ten shows for this first season everybody was playing
i'm i just did a lot of research on rock and roll i did a lottery search on drugs that liked that she probably would have
anything other than prescription drugs that i've needed of for various you know it's a surgery are you know whatever but i'm you know i've i've not but i'm very prow like a very primary onea actually but yet i've never smoked mere one
friendship and loyalty and so it's you don't want to rescue me which denis did years ago one had such huge success with it was a one hour drama with commutic elements and now were doing a half hour comedy with some dramatic elements to it so it is very funny and so it's some dramatic elements to it so it is very funny for me and so it's so it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
dennis like with threw it all away he would give us a script and then say come in and he went he went away he would give us a script and then say come in and he went he went he went he went away he would give us a script and then say come in and then us like with threw it all away he would give us a script and then us like wi threw it all away he would give us a script through it all away he would give us a scrip all away he would give us a script and then us a script and then us a scrufft and then us like threw it all away he would throw it all away he would give us a scrufft and then us a scrept through it all away he would throw it all away he would give us a scruffs like we'in us a scruffer threw it all away he would
as going on at all times since it was a very messy and raw and i think that's what
john jed is coming two hours said to daisy and she was awesome but she's just a coolch
and she played herself but like it did involve some acting and so she was great she was game and
most its denis leary i think that's kind of what all of us were drawn to i mean he's so specific in his style he's so successful and he's just a great guy his ease of really great guy to work for
and he over the ears is just he's nose a lot of people on his as state and touch with a lot of people so you know really kind of it just involves a fun call rim and then if some one's available so
of the showit's its it makes of it makes it very specific and it makes it its own
is that ah particularly the men in the rock industry like choose a look and then they stick with it and so johnny rock chose a look and he has stuck
good all the time and ava has kept it but given it a more modern touch so i it's fun because even like there's no off switch with
like that it just it that it doesn't happen except for insects and drugs
good question i'm first person who pops into my mind who i'm i get likened too frequently and i take it as a great compliment would be charlotte's
or intimate a little loosely and i've now intimately worked with them but yado i'm
and lise has said that before and i don't see it i just don't see it and maybe it's because i worked with them both ah
yes so i don't know but agin at that just it's a gascon in the eye of the
it's great for animals but it's also great for your health because we're really not built to consume as much meat as we do in modern days so if people knew what was happening to animals if they really knew and if they really absorbed it they would make i believe they would make different choices it isn't in lot of its just getting people
on the eating front that people that somehow it taps into like this i'm survival in the spheres of a no i have to eat meats or survive and then it does become a habit like no eye i need this and you actually really don't you really really really don't you just need protein but that protein does not have to come from animal sources i'm so yes but that
years ago i made what i call the fortunate mistake of watching an under cover fur vitio and it
only honoured at the national animal rights conference with their guardian award and also with aetellia ward for my work on
anything getting an award because it's not really about me it's about the work and i just happen to be to feel
a stream to merge my work in entertainment and my work with animals because i believe that we can end animal suffering
and a lot of like drama inside that comedy which of course is what makes it funny because it's just so absurd and so kind of real and in this crazy desponctional world so
insanity and i think everybody just come once to be a part of that such goings like going on like going once i don't like going to once i don't like going to and sanity and i think everybody just come once to be a part of that insanity and i think i never bade us come once to be a insanity and i canity and i think of a day and i think of a day and i think of a day and i think of a bad just come to because i canon
i i my function is really like to help protect him usually from himself but really like a he goes off the cliff i'm going off
gillies who plays denises daughter on the show and yet everybody's playing life instruments and we we are sex and drugs in rock and wall
but i think i'm going to be here in los angeles i'll be in new york look at the days before for the premier and press and what not but i think i'm getting come back here and have just a little gag
as were so comfortable with each other and i think actually in our own weird way were very much in love so so so
young and hollywood anne's i'm and the mat changed it and an i've felt served focussing and acting and now
i am i like to think of myself anyway as a good happy person who likes to help others and be positive and so i get to really exercise that shadow side of myself who is not so
yes well my organization is the pet matchmaker yeb and dumb we with inspire and celebrate rescue foster adoption of homeless animals
there's so many on parts to that that we're just disturbing from him from the alleged killer luring him out of a pretended area to what they did to the to the lion
yes of this saturday six o'clock kitty bungalow dot or
the motion kept her actress for alice wester in resonant evil revelations too and you
i was hired tom or a vitiogae and actually it even know what the game was and i went in and i could do all these wardrobe fittings and
had no idea what the game was and it wasn't until this
fifteen that i started getting messages and searching images of alex west
three sixty and then they put all these different like proves on me all these different like proves on me all all
have been a big fan of the original and it was with it i think of some early neat story i was first introduced to the series when i was filming in australia i was doing a walter's name of the called inspector tajetu there and some calf mace and i were just hanging out
or seen the movies and in what not and but then when the revelations came up i actually haven't played again
have it seen it in its entirety of been getting all kinds of messages though and am sing fan art to em let them
it's really cool to be a part of this franchise and an exuper super super super super super super super super super super supernum really cool to be a part of this really cool to be a part of this really cool to be a part of this branche really cool to be a part of this franchise really cool to be a part of this franc of this franchis really cool to be a part of this franchiel to be a part of this franc of this franc of this francrits of this franci a part of this francris and an a part of this franci coulets and an eper's in its really cool to be a part of this franc of this franc of this franc size and an es and an a part of this franc of this franc size and an eaullie coolie coolie coolie cool to bes and an
ah i thought it was really cool and i think they did a great job of capturing me i've seen some
laying on an evil character or playing it a game that involved you know a certain level of violence but again i didn't know what game it was i'm when they hired it all top secret
so they didn't tell me a whole lot of but i just knew that it was going to be
that it was really fascinating about it as a lot of fine and the fans had been incredible ah i would also love
and you have i am a big believer of manton's south's wrinkles a quality i possess i am excessively trained to answer and so
and so that's just what i think i do for every wall and at that end of
the type of the elm that as an actor in my fondest reign at the
nearer to my heartwright now is my own animal rescue organization that i'm a founding member of called animal rescue corn the warmth of a man i'll be du larkscoper's shoes like poppy mills marty in dot's lead is like dog
the more rescue organization adam a founding member of called animal risky before
that's taking up a lot of time but it is so worth that like a love every for those
doubtless it's a very very real journey i think as well i think that's why people can relate to it because you know the castle
i think one something is so i conically cornish you know i wanted to get it right so you've enough time with for you
then everything else is tied in with that in a good sea to eye on top of it and everything
sir simon came shots of giants grabbing you and stuff your bodies not moving in the right way or if even if the chemist is slightly off in the hold
back to her roots because she missus hare her family and her friends and her she's made like her brother and and then all this kind of
house and i shouldn't talk me through it because when it being and fixed years you're the petals keep moving without
so you can't she stop so it's terrifying i ne'er very hard to act for i could really get van and the great allen so you're just fit a lot of kind of cycling up and down the cycljacks near my house and here shanny
it was very scaring it was very very scary to be and amongst that inter to see that we know the likes tell that they live but i am at the same time that was kind of up is really exciting about it and why i love
relationships that you thought were so solid in the first series again again again again again again again again thoughts were so solid in the first series again again again again again again relationships that you thought were so solid in the first series again relationships that you thought were so solid in the first series again relationships that you thought were so solid and the first series againstships that you thought were so solid and the relationships that you thoughts that you thought were so solid were so solid and the first series again
and standing up to people if you don't agree with them my women we're not conforming
this being my first kind of big firm big brake both of them were just so supported that already nice i can have took me under the wing
a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for every one but m you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression on one it's a dear everything every one in the movie justice and i wanted to do the character justice is it's not often
that was kind of quite intense but i i loved her i really embrace a charm
if the moving that's when you can't depend on brion's head and talky through it and to show
i'm previzer of what he's planning what the chance looking like what's had to have the movement of the scene is going to play
if you depend on him following her at the bean stalk so you know we have to it we had to anne create her relationship within a week we had to and create her relationship within a ship within a week we have to end on him following her at the bean stalk so if you depends on him following her at the bean stalk so if you depends on him following her at the bean stalk the bean stalk so we depends on him following hert the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the beans on him following heart the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk following heart the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean stalk the bean
definite and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with c gyne special effects and it's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's a great family movie and i think there people love the kind of ghostness in a mode their family and watch something that every one can
and well i think demands as a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're rare those great characters said they don't come along that often and but i
than to progress into lady of nanpara and an a gentleman's wife it's such a gradgrindy of nanpara and a gentleman's wife it's such a great such a great lady of nanpara and a gentleman's wife it's such a dressing to lady of nanpara and a gentleman's progressing to lady of empire and a gentleman's progress into a lady of progressing to lady of nanpara and a lady of nanpara in two lady of nanpara and a gentleman's in two lady of nanpara and a gentleman's in two lady of nanpara and a gentlemanpara and a gentleman to a gentleman to a gentleman to a gentleman's a gentleman to lady of an in two lady of nanpara in two lady of nanpara and a gentleman's and a gentleman to a gentleman to a gentleman to lady of nanpara and a gentleman
yes very much so very much so and there relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but they're still turmoil in a
right after season one m and we've just lost our child so we dealing with that and ross is going to be tried m
season to us is very unexciting and upsetting and it's a real rolicose to the whole series
ah i worked very hard at the fabulous voice coach for weeks before filming and because it was so important to me that we got it right inerts
salute your lover so we really had to nail that and get that right my hope as it is so we really had to nail that and get that right my hope as it is
but it's some yeah i think throughout the series as well i wanted her ter sof on the axe
absolutely as that spent has been great sir to work without often saying that i work very closely with the costume and make up people to create this realistic look that changes as we get old
he with a tool and you know what he's such a lovely person he's and i think he's a bit
to be honest is just given me so many more opportunities acting wise which is lovely in its greater part of shows been such a huge success because
so do absolutely anything for him you know she as a wife who seems i should try to save his neck
over that and chinese woman alive so you know this a lot of emotion and exploring the reality of envy married and i see how hard that isn't i think that's what more love about
i really was but i'm yet that mean at the same time you've planned a good contemn with the c g i and really selling how terrifying these giants are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with it's rather it was a great
the priests off it they've shot with you now over them although
the stuff that they've shot with the bill nigh already and obviously his stuff is played back to us and all the motion catches
i really expect to hear her man leads her rather at room and i am even here back to the life that she left of being in her room and here he is in the air back to the life that she left of doing him for
well it's to be a perfect unit of the i'm not entirely sure to hear i will ever
a different side to me that i am wanting to have expressed for a while sir em so as kit was right and immediately i was grabbed by the projecting and greatly different said the other ready to grow myself into
with hers her real couriers and returning gilmingen it was really interesting to actually
speak to them and i think narrow you'd expect that we much more accidents than the orb
really sick or ill and i think i haven't managed to go up there you certainly get
young and she's passionate and she's was born into the raw family she didn't choose the life that comes with it so
and have her own experiences before she takes on that responsibility no she doesn't just want to
an incredible vision and he's his grace getting sharing that with you know when some one is that kind of inspired it's amazing to kind of you really feel that and yet gives you hope and it makes you trust them so that you know the ear and
the best time working on there simeon it was such an experience a roll of oyster from daylight
just any tom dick and harriod roger or you know it's it a head of use led by brine
the movie that we've all achieved together you know we became a real team and i think that we have we have something that's really call and hopefully will be a great film that would be part of a family's life you know either for young kids or adults there is something
alice fantastically in a we did a lot of training for the roll so if we wanted to be able to do our own stunts to do justice to our characters because that's that such part of the twist particularly isabel is that she is fistain she is searching for adventure so she throws herself at everything so i loved all of the actioning offices interrupting with giants and being put in the harnessers so it made it looked like the giant her a hold of you was
i found the scene at the beginning in jack's house really challenging because even the dialogue in that scene as well can have creating that relationship between jack and his about it is so crucial to the movie and you only have one scene to do it in because in the next minute she's taken up the bean stalk so can you have creating a chemistry between the two of them that was believeable that he would then climb miss bean
reading fairy tales at night is not i hope it's not dying breed by any means but we now with in a i am tivy film i pads whatever there is something in a child's magic
pick up sensitively from where you left off and the cross is being tried so
to deal with but i think the main thing is real life marriage and this are the woman that just where
yes i did and i'm not sure why but i just thought it would
east and being the hero that ere rospolledarch is he punishes
yes i should really understand as last time we were here the show hadn't aired here as no one really knew what it was so i'm kind of excited in order to see what people's reaction was to the first
m well the great thing my season too is the our characters are very much already established so it's basically working on the relationships that you feel as so solid
fiercely protective of famine and them she'll do absolutely anything for him you know she as quite few scenes as she tries to you know save his neck very sickly because he
he stands up for he believes in and doesn't necessarily think about the consequences of that and how terrifying it
i i'm half way through books six so the actors we do two books at a time and
yea i think i think at the heart of it you know it's the story of an under dog it's a story of a real romance and you know you have these incredibly relatable characters at the heart of it i think that will people love a lasser and them you know it was such a hugh's success before so you know doing a new adaptation of it was incredibly scary scary because you wanted to be as good as the first good as the first good as the first of us before so you know doing a new adaptation of it was incredibl of it was incredibl as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as a new adaptation of it was in a new adaptation of it was incredibl as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as good as
it's m it's been is to him really nicer than i think the thing to remember that it is different from the previous serious serious thing to remember that it is different from the previous serious serious theory i think that the thing to remembers it's m it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's been it's to him really nice to him really nice to him really nice of him really nice of really nice of him really nice of him really nice of him really nice
in its inertinual adaptation of the books and them and that's been really cool enough lovely to have
and well i think demands as a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're rare those great characters said they don't come along that often and but i
began to progress into lady of nanpara and an a gentleman's wife it's such a
yes very much so very much there and there relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but they're still turmoil in a
right after season one m and we've just lost our child so we dealing with that and ross is going to be tried m
in twos is very unexciting and upsetting and it's a real rollic host of the whole series
ah i worked very hard with a fabulous voiced coach for weeks before filming and because it was so important to me that we got it right you know it's
yes but it's some yes i think throughout the series as well i wanted her to soften the axe
absolutely as that spin has been great to it to work without often say that i work very closely with the costume and make up people to create this realistic look that changes as we get older
he with a soul and you know what he's such a lovely person he's and i think he's a bit
to be honest is just given me so many more opportunities acting wise which is lovely in its great superior show has been such a huge success because
really was for and yet there mean at the same time you've kind of got to contend with the c g i and really selling how terrifying these giants are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with us are
this stuff that they've shot with the bill nigh already and obviously his stuff is played back to us and all the motion catches
hard work but here i mean it if the maiden that's when you can have depended on brian to have a cooky through it and to show you i'm previous of what he's planned in what the chance looking like what i had to have the movement of the scene is going to play out
so in all we have to we had to run create relationship within
a scene right the beginning of the fence that was kind of inner that was very difficult and it took us quite a while to kind of find the right bow
definitely and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with see gyrion special effects and it's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's
with this being my first kind of big film big break both of them were just so supported they were really nice they can have took me under their wing and nature that i was okay and that's that
know that it is a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for every one but m you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression on one it's a dear everything every one in the movie justice and i wanted to do the character just
well it was i thought of long process really and i went for my first edition and i just read
like a series of editions after that and then a series of workshops and then they often read the parts it was a long process but it was thrilling and suddenly a drannaline you get from man it's
mean making this navy was so much fun i mean i loved absolutely every every every every everyday was so much fun i mean i loved absolutely every every every every every every every everything was so much fun i mean i mean making this navy was so much fun i mean i mean making this navy was so much fun i mean i mean making this navy with so much fun i mean making this navy with so much fun i mean making this navy with so much fun i mean i mean making this navy was so much fun i mean with so much fun i mean with so much fun i mean with so much fun i mean with so much fune
anything really i mean just anything that's classy and that i know that i'm rude again and enjoy something
reddy gets duckinsy added quite like an action firm which has but a sword fighting or something in it or something that i've not experienced here
really bright position where i can manage what i wanted and i start a getting offers to do a lot of and big studio movings and none of the strips excited me and i just started looking at different things in the world that were disturbing me and i'd seen this webside we could go to tyland and pay ten thousand dollars walkers who rum and shoot somebody in the head
so much i sits through that substance right direct for this do my own move a happened leaking drink in a crater
and after he saw the move he invited me to his house to watch the news and i think we're watching more than our gangways or helma here some old film and out we certainly thought me much of
gotter at that point now self i just ran home i'm put my phone shot off my
amelia it was grey and me i grew up in boston and there's a certain tepid guy from boston we called mass
mackay drink they and hattie and you know i went to side live with those guys and had beat up but there wasn't there was one of those guides so a lot of the times you know when you're onset you could cut an acroc that billet do
but quite in lunch enemy brad was although and i was donny the marriage of the whole time and there was the cane in carlisles i call
these guides my head for eight years and i get to hang out of them this is so cool so but in of the beating scenes it was very cathartic to get that out of your system but you know the truth is that when i'm filming it death seems i get happier and happier as the day goes on as i'm getting my shot
conjure up the most painful darkest stuff from your entire life and bring it right to the surface i could just happen ten minutes ago so i noticed that the end of the day i was just drained i don't want to talk to anybody you want to crawl into a hole and die and then get up and do it again the next day so certain days were fine but on the days when i had to kill somebody it was really really much more and tens
thing that you were never supposed to do but you know there was a real purpose to it and me this wasn't for shock this was and we know and we were shooting going ocave this has to hang with the glorious bastard so i had to bring it
face book made of these social media but ino if you're in fourteen fifteen sixteen or in your early twenties and you've grown up with that you know all these different tricks you're the whole mentality of how to use social media i'm and how do you suffer it's
it eatates completely different and what's terrifying to me to someone in the forties that there is nothing private any more knows a whole generation that's grown up with no concept of privacy there's broadcast
oscope and but we grew up in this era where could allevier behavior for me before
it's not recorded thank god so i'm i wanted to show what can happen that it would terrifie me as the idea that in on the time of fatal attraction you could do something like this maybe your wife found out made you peep at work but now if you misbehavied cheat on your wife you do something wrong it can literally be brought cast to the whole
together i hope well we really need sir preface a week he's a what i go down to have this house and these people moved out and made those arms because are you too insane or unable to keep people moved out and made those arms because are you too insane or they weren't well we really need sir prefin a week he's got there i don't i don't i don't i don't well i don't well we will we really know well we really we really we really do well we really need sir prefin a week he't well we will we really answer i don't well we really he't well we really he't well we really eat sir preff in a week he't laugh in a week he's a week he's a week he's a week he's a
it was a combination several minutes one i was watching the old seventy's cannibal films
never make that movie to day because the jungle is not very more and it's gone it's all despairing without a cadat's my end it's like it's on a
to protect the general to stop the end of the uncontacted tribes but at the same time occupied wall street was happening and during occupy wall street there was a relative of mine who was occupying and i'm very graduated college and as i got it is he working what's he doing and my mamma was like i know he's occupying and i suppose he ought to show what's a really going against to because he has a reality like everybody like everybody like everybody like reuben in a nice family and went to college and went to college and went to college and when to call it is this friend's he knows to call it is this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's he knows this friend's
an agirl cigar when he's like paying and there's a trench let's a real poisonous torrential in it's frying mine so everybody in the cast fully fully went for it and i think that's one of the reasons the movie really works when you see them there in the dirt and they're surrounded by pig ship and are getting bit by bugs are still make up there
and the greatest and cast members to the hospital we had to take get yellow fever shots we had answered malaripels we had to get deeper aside it after
and resided gravely when the girls when the kids drop a snake on carbine and magnus face that is a real snake that was i was standing there in the kid's turn round the lake they like all the kids up to have an idea and they had a baby python and that i was like what do they want to go with the kids started to take
i look at it if you freeze frame with it the things like two inches from fighting your face so it's just that kind of a shoot but you know
and i don't know he told me the story and i said i would do anything to help you make this moving we read the scream play and bring it to our partner's erik newman to mark abraham her fantastic producers and y don't make a lot of great movies then we take it to universal with that team and then we bring on bill kong and kore you when comes on for the fights and it just snowballs from them
not to sing another fight you move in the story for but you're really unfolding another corner of this world with a wow o k that's the roads i'll katy's guess go on to ground that's really cool katy's the falcons they live in the trees and thinking of its jungle village we wanted to really create you
universal as we spend a year and a half in the writing thinking of every clan thinking of their weapon thinking of what their relationship is of other clans so that you know whether
you know also the rhythm the rhythm of the dilem there was a lot but in it it's it really a kind of harnessing what he did withoutang he really was able to produce all of that and really bring in day betist and russell crow and connie west and west and west caliph and cribilla all these people from all these different worlds i'm you know everybody to gather and
these nets or k kiss to me it was always make believe and pretend and i always thought no matter what i'm doing on a movie centers nothing worse than was going on in the real world i made people
and should all their just pigeons as if these are creatures these are animals and the actual member make the guiltshipping
i couldn't i couldn't be in the houseroom or couldn't be friends at this person knowing that these people left their dog out there suffering and the absurdity of what was just a dog which you could see how upset this animal was so i had very always very very affected by violence and real life and certainly violence against animal
in good fine i guess he could say but i wanted to use that attention that i get
where this hobby we had collecting all these cards we now have them but we justly enter it with
in december two thousand four and then he acted like a weak crispindego with his scrip because hay won't he receive from going to bastard
around april of two thousand eight while he was writing it isn't my passover satyr it was with all my friends of boston boss to boston once to boston and use it my passover satyr it was with all my friends of boston boston boston once to boston ayl round ayl round april of two thousand eight while he was writing it news writing it and around ayl round ayprical of two thousand eight roll of two thousand eight rolls of two thousand eight pearls of two thousand eight pearls of two thousand eight thousand eight thousand eight thousand eight thousand eight thousand eight thousand eight miles writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it was writing it round eight roll he was writing it was writing it round eight roll of two thousand
least for boleyn he calls me in it asked me to give god perhaps a food with him so were dinner and he said look don't always has to be a real character this is a death purpose god got to know this like your best friends can be three hundred sixty three persons whose is pere and i was like well quite night it wasn't going to do that research until i knew i had
tell me on to be like in the like a lean rolled brad pattens like yawakudo tells he's a cut here chairs and we'd stay exact that's it but i dropped everything put on forty pounds a muscle went to boston and
everyone to see it's everything that i had fantasized about visual
it's exactly what you would do it's like you this dream that you had you realized that somebody else had that same dream and now you're sharing it with all these are people
sorry that's what the best grains of it felt like the energy of the red carpet of canned was in that room as i have never been to screen like that was like a lecturate
night he admitted moving up and we've leading up to it he shook good badly ugly should the dirty dust any
like its raw tail and shivering on the far firing into a crowd and when he said the ending he's like dark at the sun
business is changing to such a degree that you're finding that movies are can small beauty releases or it's moral and clearly what audiences are going to and what theatres are booking are starworth's movies and these can offend superero films so ah it certainly they're a lot of fun you had a lot of money to play with em in the note they don't
it's interesting it's a it's a whole other universe it's happening right now
i first had the idea to write and direct cannibal holidays
believe what i had just seen and it was before the inner net so i couldn't just go up and look up information and i tried to find it in every book and i was i
actually killed people and i studied special effects i'd seen every make of effect but i had never seen anything so effective the film making the documentary style and of course the resort to lawney music i'm and that was what began my obsession with the movie and of course reading about rogiero and subsequently realizing that he had directed all the movies that i loved as well but it seemed as well but it seemed like he really murdered
every review ever by any one the first
talk about as cannibal hohlakov's cat of the holocaust and the holly would report poor poor poor poor hohlakov's cat of ohio cost and the holly would report poor poor poor poor poor hohlakov's cat of a hollowcast and the holocas and the holocaulay talk about as count of hollowas cataboutas cat of a hollowas cat of a hollowas cat of a hollowacos cat of a hollowas and a hollowcas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the hollowcas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holocas and the holahas and the holocauas the holocautocas capable holocas the hollowhocas the hollowa
become overtime the gold standard for a like it's like the ultimate outlaw harm of it there's nothing there is no close
was going to work and to really start the movie i was paying myself for my own money to fly the crew to go to peru and while we were there like right before shooting was when the finances came together but i had to say yes we're going as we're going we were fighting the weather and then we were in the jungle and i started production and every day was thinking i really to write roget i really i really i really i really knew to write roget a really i really i really i really i really i really i really i really i really i really knew to really knew it really i really i really i really i really i really i really knew to read it really i really knew it really i really knew it really i really knew it really i really i real
tell him write what i get back in december but by then the news had gotten out i felt terribly that you didn't hear it from me first
bolikos is the inspiration and it's a very different type of story and the name the green inferno but the idea was i want
no that's cattle also among the country body has the finger thing that you'll see to morrow night remember much everything but i
really for a modern american audiences what cause it couldn't be as strong as cannibal holocaust it's a different story but i want you notice in the credits i
ay kind of a holocaust i want people that may be of never seen it that are too scared to see it to watch green and furdo and then go fine cannibal holocaust if they have a
i like i like fitz corral though i like the scenes with the natives when the natives come on the road and pending
but the one where we shot is by a gear the wrath of god cause they called the pogolo year day and we went far
but the difference but also let him all go for my entree
the difference obviously very i think that what makes cannibal holidays unique that a lot of people don't know is that you are the everybody knows you are the assistant director to robert ferrissa leni but not many people know that you are these
he is right in crime novels and detective stories now and his crime films are incredible i mean you make great crime films as well but when we think of lindsey i think of the italian crime and if you look at cannibal ferrar
an incanable fair ox there finding a detective more it's the keep cutting back to new york
back to this police but lindsey loves the detective story so i think that instead of com
every single day others no electricity no running water these people had not only never seen a move

moving there's nothing worse than what's going on in new orleans i mean i can put the most violent stuff in a film and people know its fate they're paying for fantasy they've seen the actor
during interviews they know they're alive so it allows them to enjoy the violence what pickets people decensitized is when their school shootings every week it's when we say oh another ten people were killed in a rack when we have this
hirifying that anything i could ever put in a movie in its real and that makes people think god you know it there's no police there's no army no one's can save us everything's can fall apart there's horrible rations that shape racial tension and nobody's in charge that's what gets people decensized the more terrifying that's that's anything i gets the more gets

rock dead fred with rick may i was known as one of the funny scrips ever written and some dutch director came in and like didn't know how to use reck mails like a con
genius and moves a mess so it's like it was fresh running for the director as freshman's rider as fresher into the starboard you know just how the wrong ingredients
and an ounce of produced my own movies i think for me the only way to do it is to write producing direct because if i write a moving you give it to a director and they screw it up it's like
you know it's so frustrating and there's its like this movie drop dead fred with rick may all was known as one of the funning scrips ever written and some dutch director came in and like didn't know how to use wreck mails like a comic genius and the moves a mes so it's like it was a director and i write it and i write it as fresh ring for the star but you know just come had the wrong ingredients but when you have an idea in your head and i write it and i write it and i write it and i write it and i write it and i write it was a drank it was a drank it was a dros it was a drank it was a dros it was a dros it was a dros it and i write it was a dros it was a dros it and i write it

craven was one of those names that as you got older his films grew with you so when i was a cat it was before vizirs so
was the film at your friend's older brother saw so you'd have them going all that's a movie and they take the girl
any of last house in the left and a houses kind of hairy nelson folky music done by david alexander hess and i'm ever thinking like god this is ninety seventy two and this is two thousand to you couldn't use this music in a movie to day and i thought that's at him i'm going to do it i'm in a track down that music and so i took six songs from last in the left and i got the guy who plays the killer who sings the killer who sings these songs it was his kids it was his kids did a cover for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the anchor for the angry six songss and itself from last house from last house from last house from last house from last house in the gate he gave him to the left and i got the left and i got the left and i got
and he sought he heard the last house and left music and was like o my god disguised the real deal and it met west and i was like a highness to meet you sorry i stole six times from your movie
about five or six years ago this trailer showed up around hallow e n a for moody called clown where guy puts on a clown suit for his kit's birthday party can't take it off and he starts turning into this monster and the hair he keeps cutting the hair and it grows back and he rips the nose fuses it and then it said
even though he hadn't done a feature his commercial envios were so smart they used part of this collective smuggler films and his stuff just looked amazing everything he did had that real beautiful clean polish a m and i just knew if he applied that aesthetic to a horror film he'd make something really second film cock car his fantastic
it was it was a pleasure it's it's nice when you work with the director like john it's the same experience i had with ty west making the sacramentor daniel standering last exercises and where you can just really be there as support but just
grim's fairy tales going back hundreds of years and in those of the oldest horror stories there are and there's a reason we've been telling them
eat my witches and eat my trolls so i'm when you're dealing with clowns i think what makes clowns creep
that they are around children and that we do let them around children and that when we is children were so fascinated by them that you think all my goshes is a grown man that we let her on kids just because they've cloud make upon and then
when good humor used that to do horrible things to children so i think that's reclined started to get a bad name is being creepy and there hadn't really been a hard feminine while that explored that and i think that what john came up was that was so clever as the idea that it's not the
he's evil it's the suit that's evil that when he once who ever puts this on it's going to transform into this thing and in that way it really becomes much more like the fly and that's what i thought was brilliant was their way and to tell this story that it's not just a okeet clown to help your care to help your care to make a clown because the clown you wanted to put on the birthday party and you just put on the wrong clown suit
you really feel for the sky as he's trying to resist the urge but m you know we wanted to stay true to the fairy tale withology and that's what we meant to move it that was you know probably
there is the you won't have some sort of message underneath it i never like to go to the movies and have a history lesson forced down my throat but i love when i'm watching gorry movies over and over and watch the people's heads be ripped off and guts get torn out and then you realize that the direct
told me about this earthquake that hit in february two thousand ten and chilly and was in eight point
basically society collapsed where ate he said it was whole generation their eyebones went out so nobody knew anyone's phone numbers and without cheapy asked nobody knew how to get anywhere and he was each called his girl for in the phocchie's like galleum at the coast they owed there's just a sonomeny when we were in the phocchisacly basically basically basically basically susically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsed where a basically society collapsed toyclely society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsically society collapsed where a basically society collapsically society collapsed where a basically society collapsically society collaps
i had heard he was out dishing a people for it and then the night before he leaves your balloon he's a hangarm starting when he gets some food i'm sure i knew he's making his movement and hadn't bothered him

perhaps we all dispersed into tears it was somewhere even though we knew it was for ten that as my father said there was the historical reality and emotional reality i am as my father said there was the historical reality and emotional reality i am
and acted with everybody so that's quite enough he so tuned into these things that you just does need of that everyone's efforts at everyone's efforts at everyone's efforts at everyone's and toned into these things that you just does need of that everyone's and now he's so tuned into these things that everybody's everybody's of everybody's if that's quite enough that's quaint and now he's quite enough he's so tuned and now he's so tuned and now he's so tuned into these things to bet and now he's to these things to bet to bet to bes to bet to bet and now he's to bet and now he's to these things to beted to bes to bes to bes to bes to bes to bes to bes to bes to be

ah it's my great advocate team and i would spun took a whole or whole chilly wood crew with nicholas lopez gave him a weight of our team
enschille and chrysalerezza an ignosian air burns the whole cast
exactly well that's all ideas and i want to use the camera work to tell the story into a show character and there's three kind of moves through the house where we take our time going through the first time as just in choosing everything the second time as at night and the third time as the animal next was completely struck
i'm going here i'm and it was just such a pleasure to work with counterrease and a you know an finding credule and credible talent like on a dormice and give her her english language breaks amazing amazing
young look i mean they're movies like the strangers and funny games that i really like vera one of the things that struck me by peter trainer's death game which calling camp was in and nighted seventy five very very little scene filmed for the camera a masterpiece ah is the the the way these girls show up that this the premise of two girls showing after house and cheating on your wife and then they won't leave and really unrave her really unravells your life and what happens your life and what happens when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose control your life and what happens when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls when you lose controls
kiana lets the vampire and you in fatal attraction dan makes the mistake you know i won't pay it no herd dan like it's dan's fault and that's what's garry they know that if weather's hard candy or even blansky's death in the maiden does a great job that was a thousand big employ
on a pursuer also i'm forty three and the way i would use social mediaries face barker twitter anythings is completely different than the way a seventeen
i remember the icelanders were alike do you cut early american doesn't know how to shave like their looking at me they've come out with
for an foreign country it can be scare going to hospital especially when you walk into the doctor's office
so finally she liked schuitz kenet they have a sample of it i went sure
and there like game it was some crazy ringworm infection then i got and
it was a that's what inspired the movie i thought why you could be totally healthy and
hands when you're when you create an inshall it's not like watching
racing and loving at him the show was wildly successful and hopefully as
or at argentina she liked the fans are the same they love it and it's really great when you can give
scary story set in that world in every country has their own monster
country has its own you know that the ghost and companion to pam the girls look the well the hair
every country has their own porous stories and people love it when you can take a classic like the vampire where will frank assign the monsters and re invent them an interesting way and as we thought primogene really did with his novel hymnogrove and we wanted to create a series that felt something like a more in the style of david lyne's twin deeds but almost with a tug was served melodrama
of pemlogrove people really people are fascinated at small time
and like and we've created we were very hard to create a universe that is something special and unique and of course that is something special and unique and of course courts and of course courts and we've created we were very unlike and we've created we were very hard to like and we've created we were very hard to like and we've created we were very hard to like and we've created we weren like and we't created we't created we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create it we were very hard to create
you're sniffing at other it's like a serious offence in a relationship ah but now it was it was instrumental in the i heard season one when they we talked about all thirteen episodes going once a real change away we could write the show we did not write for commercial rites we didn't have to do re cap
it's you right there in your heart you would your friends have put it on you much another one and another one and we knew that in one
but we love rye mc ruby's novel and the first season we were fitting thirteen episodes to that novel so there were times who could feel we were stretching we felt in watching it after without cagaphiel this when we stretched it a little bit to get to this story
deeds dealt much deeper into her character because she such as she such an incredible act with such amazing rage we wanted to show all the different layers
of olivia and we fitted to tanapuso so that everything was story story story but we wrote it knowing that people in general are watching through
their series of ten and sir stretching having this huge moments like the transformation i was to be one
turn turns back into a human we what is that muck we got to see what that looks like and spares herself
we realized that at ten episodes we were just a little more focussed and we could really make each episode like leads focus on making ten amazing amazements
sews and really putting really writing those huge kind of big sad pieces that work you'll go all my god a can i've never seen that done before i'm and with every one it was just one or management's little more
thirteen worked for the book but now that we were a m in a creative
on our own without the book we thought the ten would be really gillis my ten and really will
getting shapeworks under james cameron a dark angel at the guide feast he's worked with soap he's such an amazing range of experience work with such great producers
creators i'm that what was really nice was we had and we had the book last year we had
amazing to you bless even but it did feel like we we didn't have but one so the book was the central voice and we needed one person that could really be the central voice in a filter of other ideas is only half million ideas but i also don't as
my presence i can't assure you i'd eyes what if we do this like i need to weep we all agreed the best way to work was to every one's confilters everything through check and in like to say what a fly
like i'm not saying about that what we would think how nice it would happen to peter he's been so careful about being a far gone boy and everybody were being worldly and who interested and where it's transformed and he it's such a secret of thing that he would only let romeus let what if the beginning of second season he's just doing into bunch of strangers we realized just how completely
thinker hallucinating and thinking was drugs and tricks i can't should be doing as a graft when like that's it like sects of druggeal we're choosing into like trick people into thinking their loose names to sell drugs to get some of their drugs to get money like and that's what we're
nobility in force it against the wrong mood how does that star commit you know in saying what is that we have
it was really a metaphor for being self destructive in going up to cunning crazy drug bits are not supposed to do a but the item of the
understood how to take that idea and immediately corporation
you understand why he's doing it like and that's what great got some of my chick as he could take any crazy idea we threw at him and really understand how to turn it into story and turn it into character base story i all like think visually think ideas to be carried are we all of ideas
but chick is a is so experienced and cool and
love and he sees a great addition to the strike he has his own ideas as well so he just gave one cent of what
and how the network made did lichten mark frost solver upon this murder and the frustrateon had led to a
many of the people in the town and then they saw the murder and etty come up with wyndham or anew he'd have gone in the black lot which i swear not i love but you could tell for
explain it to athos we talk about a three season in three to five seasoned macro arts where wherever the characters are all
we but after the first season we sat down and we looked at those mackerarts when missus rut
had in a source a multi seasoned plan for where the characters were going
where we're going to go and then we've brought in check who's like completely fresh set of eyes who just watched it as a fan he's a pile of the shell but here's where i'd take it and tell you you're like oh my god that's actually an amazing idea so eight it was a combination of sir mackerock of where we were going to go but also seem what worked ever like ever together when you see roman a piecey roman a piecer when you see roman a pewter when you see roman a pewter when you see roman a peter to gather to gather to gather to gather to gather to gather to gather to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to get her to go but er to get her to go but er to go but er to go but er
or i ran to see him as much what's the please tell me shelley's dead unchalley's my thick
you can see there are lots of people that have that in some introspective poetic sense in a sigh
what there were ideas made briargreevy at that idea of me one ensued almost where can you a graphic novel of a bridge between seasoned blood and season two and nearer there are each till some
some head of a graft now or some maybe it's it's a whole uterus that we love that we love to keep expanding on
m but it's really up to the fanting of fans gives a consistent show and gives season to a chance and it only allows allows us the opportunity to further explore it in many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many many men give them but it's really up to the fant ino fantine of fantine of fens gives gives gives gives gives it consisting a consisting of but it consisting of but it consisting of its really of its really of its really of its really of the fant in offence gives the fant in offence gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives gives a canti to the cont in offence gives gives
certain forces there's a reason everyone is coming to him i grow then there's a much bigger picture at play as to why this town is becoming the the four text brothers particulars i could enter
mean it something in a week we want to lay the groundwork for a show that can go for many seasons and explore many
that this is potency upon repeated urines and if you watch a comedy
with horror the very thing you go for it is that scare and that's the thing whence you know it's coming it's never as strong a second time so when you create a show you have to make it so much more than that it can't be about the scareds got of you at the characters in the story the injury the universe the world in those great moments and those great lines and the things they do in the way they do in the way they do in the way it it it it it is such as such as such as sometimes the world
ain't we wanted we've so risked our laying the bower free really really richly universed that we won't explore in two hundred different directions but it's really our up to the fans at this point of people continued let
no i mean a week would love the fair reaction ah but the fairy action generally informs me that
the laws he had his characters in his head for eight years before the show so now fact that every one else is they are part of that universe created who loves
those of the people i want to see crash in the jungle and just get eaten because from the point of view the villagers they're just invaders they just see them as people dressed in construction suits tearing up their land and they crash in their back yard they're going to punish them like invaders so that's what's fond for me is the clash of
wish though i were i mean the village had to be a real functioning village we found some maize and village in peru and the whole village got in on the making the movie and they loved it it was so much final lot we to conceptionly explain to this village what it movie was there so cut off with no electricity many of them had never seen a telegium before let alone a move
wow that's great it's kind of an oddly pro vegetary movie even though i am a big stake eater ah i couldn't help it you know you see the civilised meat eating and the restaurant were the cutting the stake and then of course they're in the jungle and the sad truth is that eventually we all are based with food or henry worm food no matter what whether we like
just one a cause so more than that more than any sort of it was people just wanted a cause just because they felt they needed one and that's a very college thing to do and it always stuck with me those grow the image of those girls sitting there going this is unfair or striking in the janitors and then on the weakens they go back to greenwich to their house
amen i would try and charm them out tap damns i'd be like i am the entertainer i would teach them how to whistle i'd think like i could show them really good survival skills but no ultimately i'd be you know i'd bide be done how hopefully i'd be too hairy to eat the maybe they'd have to like burne me if i want a wax to go at that're it that's like eating a bear that's like eating a bear that's like eating a bear that they's like eating a bear that they'd probable if they'd probable if they'd probable if they'd costly of to skin me if they'd to skin me i wouldn'd skin me if to skin minister that they'd skin minister that they'd skin ministerless kin me i wouldn's to skin me i wouldn
i didn't know that the meaning of preappion so i rushed to the dictionary and read it i didn't know i was involved in any such
one of them one of the yet critics said where was his hand in the scene
more you cursed it showed that you had no language ability no no sense of what a
you and we all have just so many words programed into us
so i didn't speak much as it boy that day before yesterday i was in the library of congress and what
indulge in saying i don't like the language used on television to day i
heaven you turn on turn a classic films now and you're watch and you see wonderful old movie dangerous the language was not as i
carrie grant yesterday and i think call monkey business and it was wonderful a wonderful
well i don't know i just like to excite people i'd like people to share their idea
well i don't know i just like to excite people i'd like people to share their idea
i i've bill moyers had a program which was wonderful called
sadding to day i watched a lot of tavie and everybody yells at one another they scream at one another nobody listens to what the other persons saying but they all
plans out something and use the actor after obey everything he wrote he wrote we spent years with tennessee william
nor i think i think there are a lot of good playwrights to day but the theatre has
off broadway off broadway but the united states is rich in the tiny theatres all across the country
there's a regional theatre where people can watch the plays of
oh yes but some of the musicals were great in those days i mean guides them dolls as a great great musical oklahoma all of them were
there's a thing called ancoar where they revive little pieces of great great musicals on the path
because it always seems to be on the verge of dying and yet it revives itself every every once in a while a great clay ride comes along and in that the theatre has a new lean on life again
right then you had the theatre with great great shakespeare
films radio films television orlen and they have not been able to put away the fabulous invalid
we don't make up the language we obey
the archer is is the one who brings back to life what the playwright is written
orchestra player so i bring to life when the writer has written and the director has created with the author i am just carrying
the best good actor i've ever mounted on and i sent what he mean good why not great why not
par par for the cause he'll be a mother a wife have children but the other part the talent part the actor
i would lie on the bed i was in the foreign legion and owes a giving
i'm going and she'd walk out and i know then she'd lay out of the food for me to eat but that i was in my glory
spent two years with henry fander peter or tool i'll put ye
making an indentation making you aware of what life
i went up to do my first film when it was all that i rushed back to do to continue as an okanaut one
the stage manager said this somebody important of front i see please don't tell me that i don't it makes me nervous but i came out in a bow
an actor doesn't mean on a second class citizen i have to be a participant in the society so
felt it was a society that protected the idea and the thought
your hair stands up on the backy and back when you read what he wrote and all of it when
stringburg ibsen orlem are very very generous in exploring the inner thoughts of what's to appear on a stage and where lucky duff had them
keep thinking now you have tennessee williams you have arthur miller
it it reminds me of pointedism you put
ought you and just step aside step back and lay on
it's always fun for me to indulge in that mysterious
as an italian did research on a civil war that was rarely done in american film
clinny's would bless him began to do and analyze just what leone did the clothing they wore the way they would they walked the way they rode all that is a part of our his
i'm lucky to have shared in it i spent three and a half months in the jungles in campodia and i'm called what part of the united states was preparing to go to the ward viat nam and i'm making movies i've based on a book by
that the first imprint you make on film stays with you the rest of your film career the first film i did was called baby doll and i was rather a seditious
i don't think there's anything more violent than what's happening in the world to day you talk about films let's talk about the attack in the subways let's talk about viate nam that's talk about angola a bay
says he so that you can't blame the movies or television for
i don't know whether whether it's an exorcism whether it's a catholicist by seeing violence and a movie some people try to emulate what's in a movie a barma may see something in a movie and decide or go balm something you see so i think there should be less violence there should be more
i don't i what does leoline do that with me at eleven times i was angry why did i just
he only do that with me at eleven times i was angry why didn't i just come
comrades lord jim and each morning i'd go to have a bowl of soup with a
chambodian man who ran a little stand a sort of needix and he is to smile at me we spoke nothing together you know but he'd smile at me because i was
i think making films used to be an expression joined the navy and see the world as now join the movies miss
no but i i have a feeling that this some affinity you know if you think of er what's what's the word where you're resurrected where you come back as some one else what is that were
yes yes i but i'm of course the first formative years of
feeling and i wanted to channel it somehow i didn't know i stood lying on my bed and pretend it was the sahara and i was in late foreign legion and i'd get shot in the arm and my mother would come in and say it's time to eat and i'd say i'm bleeding i'm bleeding you see i was acting constantly acting who realized
fire torturing peter o'toole in the cambodian jungle somewhere and here it is my dream
i thought well damn it the place just started why isn't he paying any of the
and this monologue goes on as you're doing the play as it will maybe doesn't like me then i the other part of me says the ib part says but he paid his moneys got a perfect profit of me says the id part says but he paid his money's got a perfect perfect perfect perfect profit as you're doing the play as it and this monologue goes on as it and this monologue goes on as you's
and we didn't do what the lunch did who after a few years of marriage all of us shortly after they married sent made a pack and said we will never appear sup
toward the end of their lives they began to appear separately we've not had any rule of thumb
i had some wonderful opportunity comes up france and have filled more a play and she certainly welcomed to do it i mean in the last few years she did a play called inquest
the actor has been worried about the economic aspects you see england they he becomes sir lawrence
red thing in his legion of honor in russia he is an honored artist of this soviet union and
i would say that the best thing that can happen in america and more or more the big companies of finding it out they are devoting certain of their funds into the arts because you must a people must have more than just the
for yeast for the mind you see a good play not only entertains and amuses you
yes it does and i be does nothing better or more cleansing than a good cry

and kazan came to me and offered me a part in a movie called baby doll written by tennessee williams

the next performance i didn't get the laugh which taught me a valuable lesson that you don't do it yourself it has
it's wonderful it's great to find a thing like that to introduce it some
tell a tell you in the critic's account or you'll pray views you know you'll play for weeks
it that pulls the actor the true act and back to the theatre all the time because there's the only
you'll open a door and say i will not that's all and can't you have a day to shoot that
although people get a lot more acclaim for movie work than they do for stage work but that most satisfying for me is doing it on
i was the cruel chief on an aeroplane and all took place on an aeroplane and that all the plain crashes and all the men go back their dead and they return home a cheerful subject for just nineteen forty
and the play lasted a week i didn't think i would last either because my voice wasn't louder than
and khacan had directed the skin of our teeth and wasn't happy with his direction of fantasy so he picked a little scene from a one act play of williams called ten blocks on the camillerao
and he wanted to just work on it as a direct and i was playing in mister roberts at night after the shell was over eleven fifteen we'd meet at the act of studio and would work to one o'clock in the morning and he directed then he showed it to tennessee and tennessee was absolutely astounded what cosette had found in a fantasy sense with a scene
so he said incidentally there can do my play the roaster too and he should play man jacovalo so that's how i got to play the roast head
performance can change the message of a play the play dealt with a man me i who resists becoming a rhinoceros who resists the current who stands up and defies people you're not he doesn't turn

a street of work i ll i was playing an oriental the following year or the a few years before that in tea
four nights before paul joi had opened and they bulled the poor acted dancer who was superb in the pot so i came out to take my curtain call thinking if you're bo hung on a bull right back
i was terrified and they didn't pull but the reason they liked that place so much it was the first time americans didn't take themselves quite so seriously and didn't think they were going to inform the world of their brilliant
is not only mastered the craft of acting and also the art of carrying
it's just an annoyance at this point we are obsessive not getting that we left our madmen premier to go play
too be the best person that she can be and she might fail at it but
continue to grow i think she will continue to be floride a but we know what happened to those winds whence we're to be floride a but we know what happened to those winds whence we're continued to be floride continue to grow i think she will continue to be floride aw continued to grow i think you to grow i think you to grow i think she will continue to grow i think she will continue to be floride to be floride it to be flowed to be florid i think she will continue to be florid
private life whether or not she ever really gets a handle on matter whether she winds up he
for people especially for people that have been loyal instead of watched all of the seas
being of it also satisfactory in a way of finely getting to delve into these
yet in the truth of what happened you know and that judith would have a mind
did all our research for us ah oh mary and dan in her team
very detailed and am has a lot
a information that obviously is necessary to come of put in the film a m but for me and for every one else is really helpful the kant to have that contact
and then to even jest do the scenes over and over when you constantly serve
that they used and you know their real and their storage which is name and you know signatures and
of people and generals from that time i would never would have known otherwise
into that part of it i'm she'd i think she does she didn't know that
x obviously has played a couple of extremely well known a real life people and she was talking about it i
it would like very interested in what she was saying cause i might be doing that
oh good at it but you don't feel like she's impersonating anybody you raphael likes she's
is so uncanny intoronto bob wasn't there but dan was and i found after watching the film
they both have this sort of heroic legendary quality you know they both have that so even though they don't necessarily
somehow it's thee you really can replace bob with dan
and with them i'm after on their side i think that what you know i think that mary was right when they took
that she investigated and told on sixty minutes was
facts of of of the story that she investigated and i think that's i like
i ain't i wanted her to come if half that suit of i'm reality to her i'm besides that
the first time he cried i'm and the way we saw it in charanto he was very martial afterwards i'm in a can imagine what that's like to have served this story told that is a very important time
and to have overred for telling it you don't mean to have somebody's set to so brilliant doing it so well
somebody who is a secret of truth in his somebody who is really
three old actors in new york i was like this is him he sang please please let me play this bar oh and i loved her and i loved his character and she
a m and then it just grew from there and you know that the descriptive obviously would attract it all of us originally and then when we all got involved unique study to meet the caste in the caste was our sermon the beausiterizing the rise in the run and then it just grew from thereatrassovan mum and then it just grew from therein the room and then it just grew from therein the er and then it knew from the er and then it knew from there it knew from the er and then it knew from there it knew from the er and then it knew from the er and then it knew
criterion that didn't work out and maybe she's supposed to be like dawn maybe she was to be a man maybe she's supposed to cut herself off from being a woman and
anne i think that's seen over the past three seasons that was her such a bargain and in the four season i really feel like she's just starting she hasn't yet but i really feel she's starting to become the person that she wants she wants to starting she hasn't yet and i think that see no over the past three seasons i think that's that's that's that's that's seen that's seen that's seen over the sea no over the sea no over the past three seasons that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's the scene that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's the scene that's seen over the scene that's that's that's
and she's starting to become herself and not feel like she has to be i'm something that she has seen or someone in the office or some one or you know that she's fall
you know they make mistakes and they do bad things with their not they're not bad people you know and that's very true to life and that's very true to to to human
george jobs are selling happiness every day to the public and
if need know that againstenote their own struggle for their own personal happiness is very interesting so i don't consider any of the characters bad people i'm they do very very very very very very bad you know that that against steenote their own struggle for that that that
and me every one is so nice and a tom and luke i suppose sort of work's worth the most and i'm they couldn't be nicer gentlemen on as they did
like one of the funniest people i know he's hilarious so basely in between takes i just look sick giggling at everything
we found them both asked ah which was really copious i've never been to ireland so it was really also my really limbs i loved ireland honestly
it's a too well respected festival as a derange of phones from small films to bigger you know big lock wester films anything that you know there's a cachet and a respect that comes with the festival so it's it's an honor in a way you know ah that a few festivals are but it can't be level at a respect for terms respectable as a festival as it a few festival as it a few festival as it a few festival as it a few festival as it's a few festival as it's a few festival as it's a few festival as it a few festival as it's a few festival at a few festival at a few festival at a few festival at a few festival at a respectable as it's at a respectable as it's at a respectable as it's it's at a respectable as it's a respectable as it'
i've actually i'm part of the reason as i don't remember anything so i didn't remember what happened in the first episode till i saw it i couldn't tell you what happens in the second one some very good for spoilers because i just don't remember what happens that would have been asked recently what my favorite episodes of the show are we had to let go on line and look at all the seasons because i couldn't remember what happened when so it's so it's so i's so good for that it's so good for that it's so it's not like so it's not like so it's not like somewhat at it's not like some like somewhat at it's not like some like some one it's so it's not like some good for that it's so it's so it's so
that episode of surpassed i think what television can do or has done you know it has set a standard aum that i certainly cannot take so great a form i mean it's a brilliant scrip
i do feel like you know madmen isn't even dead and buried yet
very much not up to me but ah i don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth so you know we never know but i think i pause just a second and let people enjoy madmen
come a long way obviously do don't think her journey is over by any means a
two seasons of her three seasons were all about especially the second season as a big ark was all about her fingering out he knew what it meant to be this woman in a man's world and did she have to be like dawn or did she have to be a man or did she know did she have to play up her sexuality or
who she is and how she can just be herself and she doesn't have to be either one but she just be herself and oh i think the idea of the differences and similarities between that and now is one of the most entreating things about the show for the audience and you know just plain that game of comparison in its deftly sparked lot of m discussions and questions and i put a part of it a part of it of
first aren't watching the show and you know there's that first funny thing i like a owl i'll make out look at that so differently
besides start to see things that you see here now and things that either you've experienced or seen some one do or dine yourself and you start too sure to get uncomfortably similar
to those characters and i think that that's what is sustained the show past its the original sort of mimic of its being in that time period is that these
beings in there there they're people just really they're still like us and we're still like them and yet he thought something was become far more interesting than just it being in they
i realize what we eat what we are missing when we need those more monsters with
off as an individual that that's a good way of putting it as like a better aversion a better you not necessarily changing who you are
i was really happy with it i mean i was very happy with my story lion you know she's had a rough road as far as relationships go
decisions and ella hung over mornings and i was happy that she got the most romantic scene
some huge theatre with like thousands of coal in a lay i think they like live stream dead or whatever it's called until we watch it would like a bunch of people out of fans were there
show mat was always made sure that the other act on even the phone was always bare so had to come
and do your other side of the fun call off camera for the person it was like a rule that particularly one was different because he was in big sir i'm so they didn't want to bring me out there and i sort of insisted that they get me on the foam for it cause it was like our lad
seemed like i have to be on the other end of the phone so they actually turned the path on into a phone so that he could actually call me and was super early in the mornings i was like in bed obviously
and i'll sit in my pajama like with coffee and make my cat play all the
who is john like playing don't use a crying and i'm like trying to get the cats to be quiet
it was really heavy then the painting was cut up awkward and kind of a large young and he wanted me to hold it so that you could see it in certain shots and then the cigarette is actually
trying to look cool like trying not to drop the painting trying to take bump into the walls and then they played they're like what he when listened to and as they could stay in a lie
really valued it and was very special for us cause we're both like big fans of each other personally and professionally in and so we always really loved when we got to do stuff so i loved and at last you episodes i got like some huge flattery
the time period is so enticing and it's so beautiful to watch in there's obviously er just the time period of the six is an advertising is so enigmatic in it
oh i may obviously you know as an act of you you do bring elements of yourself to a character that's what you have to go on oh at the same time she's very different she
i'm too much more i think my eve than i am less life experience i'm so she's very different but at the same time i
a big question ah i think that you know that's a question it's been asked many times over the past five year
there are similarities and differences and things have been proved and things that have not improved and obviously we've come a long way in many ways ah that has been very beneficial to women and i think that we've lost things in other ways ah
sense of mystery about women outweighted the dress to know that sort of gone
and locky to play it i'm and then you know as far as how
you know we both try to be good people ah i think that she's a relatively honest person and she tries to do the right
and i'm the secrets of the already know about each other are
the gosh ah if they were comerch i love apple adds said thing apples pretty great i'm they've always
very different from now i'm i'd say what it's a world that i never thought i would have anything to do with and now i do just when
yes absolutely that's to mean the thing as your own people's homes and i it's funny when people come up to me i find that they'll say that to me they say
and i understand it's here in the home every week and i'm
perfect kind of moment with us pilot came along and i was in new york at the time i was cast out of new york and everybody was buzzing about this show madmen and this other show which
and m i said i want a work with that man and i meant mat a m i just was like i want a work with him
you could see that in his face and you could see that in his eyes even just in the addition and m
i loved the roll and i felt like though the what i did with the roll in that condition what i did who peggy was in that addition was the same person that he wrote so just fell like we we really clicked
she's never been in the big city and i'm now she's
and she's been working in a manse world for a few years and i think that for me the best way to describe her is just that journey that everybody go
you know twenty to thirty she grows up and she becomes harder in a lot of ways she gets a heart broken she
or not but i hope that she still retains that sense of honesty in turn of positiveity and truth that i think that you know she's very
she's just as very much believes in whatever she's
and m i think that she still has that despite the fact that she's like had some
one having to go from that front b
through these clothes which is what janey does and what any good question beside her does a m makes my drop so much easier and i don't understand her a m makes my drop so much easier and i don't answer these clothes which is what janey does and what any good question beside her does which is what janey does and what any good question besides three through these clothes which is what she's which is what janey does and what janey does and what janey does and what janey does and what janey does and what any good costume what any good costume what any good costume what any good costume would any good costume what any good costume what any good question to question besides question we questions questions question beside her question beside her costume to question beside her son does does does does does which is through these clothes which is through these clothes which is through these clothes which is close which is close which is close which is close which is close
plaid and plied with pocoa dots and like turtle eggs and then little mammy haven't got nowhere so much of them but like pants with a vett
with the character and through the clothes as ban i mean it makes my job so much
and we put it in and they played the song every time we did it and it was a miss very special kind of moment a
if he'd seen us doing it like we used to just slow dance in the middle of the office for no reason just like board you know and since season one and i asked matt if he'd seen us do it he'd said no there was a weird kind of it was just a weird coincidence in a
you you know made the scrips come first nothing else it is the story that comes first and and that's why we're still here as why people still
and i despise that fascinating so i go in i kind of make up careers are like stories to tell that overdravers i'd told them to like lithe them and i won't got in the oober like the other day and the guy was you know who's talking about his kids and like his marital problems and he's i go home while you have kids don't you and i was like you and i was like you i have two kids like you i have two kids like a boy like a boy like a boy of a boy
i must offworth this year so i'm and i went my fresh maneer which was like really
i'm she comes with me on the same lady and i'm yet what when i'm went on filming and we have to do all the work and all the tests and everything and send it back the day that it's due for everyone else why yes so it's like i have to just you have to keep up because then when you come home from near your movie if you're not if you're not if you don't keep up your light and lost
starting how on when i was little like i had the best teachers for science so they may be the kind of made me like it more and when i drink chemistry this year and then i have physics next year which i hope i still like it after that
i mean i would say that and he always has been kind of like liszel articles outright
the bookshells well am the box rolls their little creatures that live
me myself doesn't really matter it's all about the way i sound so oh i just i had to remember that and let get used to and comfortable that you don't listen matter felt the emotion in your eyes you'd have to betray the emotion that would be in your eyes and your voice so after just get those layers into the way you talk which at first i was
it was amazing i often wasn't i merely did visit portland organ weather withered weather wasn't i'm very good visit portland organ weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather weather and it it was amazing it was amazing it was amazing it was amazing it wasn't it wasn't it it it was amazing it was amazing it wasn't it was amazing it was amazing but i always amazing as i awfully i often was amazing as i often was it wasn't i often was amazing as it wasn't i often
i'd like to say that i'd like to read with him within barely disfast dissatisfied that life i didn't get to
we were i did get to meet him at kami kan whose when we went so i met him then he doesn't sound anything like sam
i'm we did a session together and with isaac we'd a accession together which was nicest you know it it was also kind of like you want other actors they are feeling tried
a we did when we talked we did the seat about talking about the fathers amene as he did that that's kind of more like an emotional not an action
you have to see the box jewels because it's extremely clever and it's unlike anything you seem before
obviously these little geys are definitely judged by a kind of their name and the way they look
they're very scared synonym and in order for them too show people who they truly are they have to overcome their fear and they have to stop being tear
is an orphan in a way so he am he's trying to figure out you know what what is the family you know what is it supposed to be and ay out we have a good talk about kind of that you know fathers always supposed to be there for you no matter what
also in a fitted fish who is one of the box trolls is like eggs father i'm even though you know he doesn't really fit you wouldn't think of him as a father cause he's a little box trolley
fit the the norm but he did he treats eggs like im like a fatherly figure so even though they're not related he still treats him that way and so he's like
well it's all handmaid so when you watch it and i feel like you
you can see the heart like an you can just tell that like fingers moulded all of this and it
it's something imming you don't you honesty don't see them doing it but it you can tell you know it's a zensit a part that's just it's not jes harm a computer it's made from
without reading the scripture anything i went in and i met with i'm rob linda and joe
and from that first meeting they they told me about the story and
i a dismal princess and i'm and from that meeting we just forgot along so well and i'm they were so nice
then on they they gave me the script after that meeting and i went home and read it right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right right i gave me the script after that meeting and i went home and read it right at right in on they they gave me the script after that meeting and after that meeting and i went home in on they on they they they gave me the script after that meeting and i gave me the scrip after that meeting and i gave me the script meeting and after that meeting and i went after that meeting and i went out of that meeting and i went home to that meeting and i went home in the script meeting and i gave me to that meeting and i gave me to that meeting and i gave me to that meeting and i gave me to that meeting and i gave me to that meeting and i gave me the script meeting and
it's the classic story of you know sleeping beauty plus so much more information so you get to
you get to know why things happen and why you know mollifs and becomes so evil in sort of steps that it takes to because you know people aren't just evil just because you know there has to be a cause and an in our film you get to sea sort of what that cause is
sort of brain the essence of her and i know like eating when you see pictures ever sort of the way she stands with their hands and no i just heard taking it all in before the move before we started filming the movie i watched that anna
i'll move you again as to sort of sea if i could pick up on any little manner it seems that she did
out of in the forest and had such a brought those little princess elements but you're also wanting to make
i'm you know have those elements but also make her a real person not jest a it's an animated character sir
fixes and there are my answers well so and when you can to see the
vague good tiny and then m when they become you note the human form when they have to take care of baby aurora you know they grow
they have to be like peasant women what did i don't think they enjoy very much they like their wings and their funny costumes
and we're with the horns and such the intensity and all that and we who definitely have the head
maleficence birds are her pet bird and she gets we get in our film we get to see him as a man as well because she turns
turns me to a man and that a when i meet and when i am little i i play with the bird i do see the bird i pet you know and i have a pretty bird is what i call him and a and then when i get old i get to sea see him in
to see his character from when he's young in sort of it's a journey for him as much as it is for mellificen in a way you get to sort of sea why he becomes so evil and why she becomes sooner so evil so they both have a reason for when he's young and why she becomes sooner so evil so they both have a reason for one he's young in sort of
that chrysity seems to him after that the lifts in sort of follows a roar around and wall a roar is growing up so you get to see me sort of indifferent stages as you know young a taut learn then sort of eight years old and then you finally see me sort of as a tingeger and malicious in a sort of veil hiding away every in every step for those
this is different adam and i and i like i like
eh and so won't you hear that unlike i hope i get to do that and then he wanted to meet with me and and
there's the story of it and what in it what it really was about and of these beauty obsessed women and i was so all in so
will the way of it i'm nick works was very a different from how i had worked before it was extremely close and we were going off instincts the old time we would change things along the way and he allowed me i never felt im this much freedom on a set he allowed me to put my
views are even as being a tinager myself i was sixteen my character was sixteen so there'd be a lot of things where i built nick she would never say this or you don't she would never wear the
freedom it was a it was a strange but amazing feeling to work that
say this or you know she would never wear this it is a bouquet we will change it with it so i never felt that freedom it was a strange but amazing feeling to work that way and we filmed in sequence in chronological order so that was very helpful because she does you know
related kind of one thing was that she's you know she's from a small town and moves to a big city and we made her from georgia which is where i'm from and moved to ellay so i understood
seeing a big city in in fresh eyes and and also being the youngest person around cause i may start it acting
when i was young so i know how it feels to be come
the pronouns that he him you know so i'm we wanted to talk with up it's nice that our film i think our films unique in that way were it's they've been living with him for a very long time now but then it's
starts where boomey wants to take the next step and get the test offstrown and un
you know it i'm not playing a female so i'm that was interesting to feel a lot of female energy but i wasn't contributing to
only will we get the senior patio which is a huge deal because m if you're not a singer you're not a senior you're not allowed to be on it as an under classman also now you can let kick off all the freshmen and kick off all the jeers with a
lean on all the doors and zip tied all the lockers shut and stole all
i was getting accepted into the like a family so that was nice she has her coral lined all and now i have my winnie so i'm it's very cool but i was really familiar with there stopped motion and you know in their movies cause i felt like a grew up with it kind of cause my sister for like seven or eight years she was voicing coraline and i did get to go to portland and visit theo's
i'll i'm an there world so i knew i was familiar with it i think they caught it they asked me to do this cause they they already knew
warm enough it's so i love thee of the teennage like the girl in it ah yet i i did get to see when i went to the box trolls i'm ah when i went to there i went up to portland and saw the set there and i saw para norman like some of their dolls they have sitting out and the girl is just so funny says her finger nails are painted pink and she has a pink and shes like a pink suit that isn't tiny that isn't tiny and it't tiny and it's real tiny and it's real tiny and it's real tiny and it's real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real tiny and its real
me i i feel you're never played i'm some one like her before could she definitely it's kind of a brown brown brown black her before could she definitely it's kind of a brown brown brown brown any i i i i i feel you're never played i'm some one like her me i i i i i i i i feel i feel you've ever played her never played a played i'm some one like her never played i i i i i i i i'm some some some some some one like her never played i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel i feel you'd i feel i feel i feel i feel you'd i feel
yes you know like she's she's not some one that you you can have wanted dislike her but then you don't
feel and know it's similar because i still prepare in the same way as i still imagine that i'm this person
and work with a script and feel like i'm still becoming a character but then it's very different cause you don't have your face to rely on you don't have your eyes to kind of show that emotion and every all the layers have to be depicted in the way you sound which at first was definitely like a challenge from meks i was like really acting with you with my face like you don't do the
just make sure that it comes out in your voice betrays the emotion so then you get more comfortable with it but that was that
i because if you are like to play that game like when i watch animated films that trying to gasp sure he noticed the lever do you go and like i think we're going to stumble out of people with this one there's one
just seeing how small these things are and realizing that every silking fusillon screen is handmaid by the oddest materials and there all have all these mechanics underneath them
can snarl and like that everything i'm and everything
is done by a human touch and i in you can really tell that like there's lot o hard that goes into it i think like five seconds takes two weeks to day
they do movies that they're not just like oh for you know funny for kids like whatever they like have like meaning to them and a there's other very
i did mine ever tode wrote with meville's younger if i did a money retorted her with my sister not
and that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that long cause it was like as first a stopped motion that they had done that they had done as it was like as first a stopped motion that they had done that took her about like seven years she was doing it and that took her about like seven years she was doing it and that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about like seven years she was doing it that took her about
what they did so then later when like just a couple years ago when they asked you to box trolls i was
kickin you and no one i i like when like new creatures or interdue
a m i would with my sister like us i was kind of trying to give attention but it never worked as i did every so year but i would like for tin that like i fell
like completely i was in shock as i loved all houses when i went i was very young i
and it was just like miniatures everywhere a
blew my mind that there were people like out there that did this it was just
yes till i knew every one and i was just i loved the box rolls scrapped and i love one
she's kind of legged unexpected you'd be character for me to play just cause i wrote her and played me one like her before she has a kind of brady element in she's like slightly spoiled a but i liked how
sighed but thin on the inside she's like loves always like little grotesque thing
and m and that was fine to should just be kind of germano and that was fine to just be kind of germano and rameau to just be kind of germano and and and and out in m m m and m and m and m and m and m and m and m and m and that was fine to m m and m and m and and and m and and that was fine to m and m and m and m and and and that was fine to m and m and and and and and and and that was fine to and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and that was and and and and and and that was and and and and that was and that was fine and that was fine and that was fine to and that was fine to and and and and and and that was fine and that was fine to and that was fine and that was fine and that was fine and that was fine and that was
at first the audience sees where they might not like her so much as little snoody but i'm but afterwards like she can't she win you over and you realize out of what she has a sensitive side and she's just trying to help eggs and get the attention from her dad that she wants and oh she's a very very
make sure that it's right i'll set me with being with other english actors in the film
little kay jobs i've been i did have a dialect coach that was with me and i'm she was on set er i
a m with me and there and she would perfect little words and get it right and we want to make i think that winnie's was a little more posture than i'd ever done cassio she's high a leet of the cheese bridge
so i mean i think so whatever it happens out no wind morgan a a m filmet but when they
eh why i have never read it before so i'll do my real duet he'll do all the research ladies
such a close fodder ever really had that with the director being so collapsative it was like i would show up in the mornings and
i'm and i was just extraordinary to have in his style and all his choices and you know that's the shot so she's so specific and everything meant something was so detailed was like doing a i'm so artistic like a photograph i was in photograph
so mixing that with you know though the fashion whirled and these women is just an extraordinary thing i think that the film you know having all those very complex themes it's a main
it's all with girls so i'm and it's not yet not yet i feel like a lot o lot o lot o lot o lot o lot o lot o lot o lot of girls so i'm and it's it's all with girls so i'm and it's all with girls so i'm and it's all with girls all with girls so i'm and it's all with girls all with girls all with girls so i's so i's so i's so i'm and i'm and it'm and and and and it's all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls all with girls so
pray that so people are just looking at this false image that's not perfect them they see a real human being they're like oh gerda not for we'll slight what you're licking
not of but yet she is five four and i'm about five six and a half but
a to morrow which ah it's very scary for me to think about as well and i think that
one person could safely throw it up together their whole lives bent every day with one
for me it was all the different emotions that ginger gets to go through and i thought it would be
completely perfect in after reading the script script is perfect in and sally
there there completely different as mine was in the six season than hers was more modern and in a different area so the complete different hurt she
accent something different i never done in accent before i'm was deadly little nervous about it just because it's something new but i'm we i'm before we start shooting
the dialect was silent and wont from san joan sat because did she want us to think more about the scenes and the characters and and have the dialects would have been already there and in a one less thing to worry about which it was nice to have it sort of
think that it was so exciting to see so many different types of people m in one filmed
french totally different personalities and but they all sorted they were together
our new york ah but she'll come ah home to allay and we spend it together
a decorator that every year i give every one an ornament in my family so oh i have like a special true tree in my family so oh i have like a special true true true true true in my family so oh i have like a special true true treatment in a decorator that every year i give every one ornament in a decorator that every year i give every year i give every one an ornament in a decorated and a decorator that every year i give it every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every year i give every one a every one a give every one a every one a every one a give every one a every one a every one a every one a give every one a every one a every one a give every one a every one a every one a give every one a give every one a every one a every one a every one a give every
accurate and beautiful and even the costumes i got to wear some really beautiful costumes and are costing designer down to like the underware and socks all from
chris cooper's the movie he's my father i'm he's the chief of police in florida and i it's you got to see her stark she's she younger and then she wants to go to hollywood to become a star but she doesn't quite make it there in fallson to cut out of a dark place and comes back in his born again his born agagin he's my father and falls my father and takes my father
and becomes an evangelous preacher during the prohibition and so she's speaking against alcohol and drugs and gambling which is bad for
he's in the scene within you don't feel like he's protecting you or directing you in you in you don't feel like he's protecting you or directing you in you
do we need where is my character going in a planet just when relied on instincts in the mornings i would show up and he'd be like so what are you ready feeling to day like what he wanted to do when i'm late i'd like
he made her to come from like a small town go to a big city which is what
looks getting her or make theirs it's like pray they so people are just looking at this false image that's not perfects them they see a real human being they're like oh germs not for we'll slight what you're looking at is fake so it's
been is bit off et cetera you know that he's a scrape that he's got a drack to have he wrote your cotton beset a star and you're like all right yes like whatever
on great a m but i of course i've read the script and really you the way that it's written
the actual sequence kind of playing out it's real so many different things going on in time periods and i'm an obviously loretta she really you know it stuck out to me and after reading our really was i hope i get the
i saw that i had to meet with ben but yes it was really great
so well and how to consecrate the best environment to
facilitate your best performance and to me and to want to i'm just let everyone be creative and
and he's just so kind of giving in that way and i'm and then as a director as i kebble it like his organization in his mind he'd owe to the switch and switch but when you're nearing his mind he'd owe to the switch and switch but when you're just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind of giving in that way and he's just so kind
he is my first day on set my first scene was the scene with a rungage but with
and it was like its very intense scene after i've liked come back from hollywood m and
the night because i think for a while she didn't really get to face her demons like she should have if she was very
busy kind of up in the clouds saying these words that she kind of i think believed in the beginning but started to start a trail off and so shouldn't really get to to face all those like she should have maybe it would have worked up better
there's a there are there's a woman a amy simple mac pherson ah which you kind of can tell me based a lot of cut of loretta's look off of her her white and the big jewelled crosses i'm in things and there was er i was you two vitios that i had watched actually us in this raising pity of her
any in the moviest sort of the lonely moor does it really have anything to do in his life and then clio so it comes in and she
no taken care of him she's making him breakfast and thinks like that she's being like the mam to him in a way and i'm but yes she's just a normal eleven year old girl i was eleven when i shot in i'm such a relate to her a lot thinks
i'm rockburnt a lot with stephen cause we did a lot of rehearsals and i
i think i got like uneasy i got like a ninety seven or something it was not a
but both of us really had to be like we play at all the time so we sorted tottentas energy the whole thing and yet we were jealous of em cause you some
i skating it helps with the balance and posture of bottom i fell a lot and when i was training i trained for a ball
a huge deal now in it got so big a sort of not even
i was to eat funny because when we were filling it with all green screen and there was in trains flying above you it wasn't like that all so seeing it for the first time with everything put together it was crazy i was screaming at you know it i couldn't believe it looked like that in it
always exactly like it was on screen really we had the best time together at night we laughed so much readers of all of them were so cool i was the youngest one i was twelve though
that's what he used to film with when he was a kid with all his friends he was like one of
we tried to perfect it so i wouldn't be no one we shot a filming that was just already there so i wouldn't be thinking about that cause the audience can definitely tell they you're hid of thinking about that one
you to catch us she we did our actions were different as mine was in the sixties and herses where maud and maud and marax were different as mine was in the sixties and herses where mauda's were mauda we did our acts as were different as different as mine was in the sixties and she we did our acts were a different as were different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different of course as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as were to katy so she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different as she we did or a different
each other tips but i'm hers was i i thought was implacable should such a
i didn't a little bit but i also i it was telegraphic that time so from that i thought it picked her pretty to doubt what it was like and so to growing up in the time of how so scary
the original animated version sleeping beauty in that one arose she's very
yet everything that you think a princess is in cut of all those characteristic she she definitely
but in ours she still is that way and she loves every one and i'm as very open and and she's not afraid afraid afraid every one and i'm is very open and she's not afraid afraid of but in ours she's still is that way and she loves every one and ours she's she still is that way and she loves that way and she loves every one and she loves every one and
it's a bolificent she's like everyone's normally so scared of me but a voracion or she hasn't learned
she doesn't learn to be scared of things that a look odd or you know creatures that have horns and i'm and it's nice for a roar and this one sheds more depth and obviously they're lot of secrets i'm there that'll get her kept from her i'm near she thinks both of her parents or dead and she lives kind of very isolated in his cottage with her three fairy aunties and i know outside of the four in em so she doesn't really no outside of the four in em so she doesn't really no outside of the four in em so she doesn't really no out you know out you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you know much about you
and it's nice that i could bring you no more layers to her and i'm and and have more strength than just cut of the pretty pretty princess you know that's in in the
a snouts or poodle mixed a hooked dog and i also have a pound of powdered mace a hooked dog and i also have a pound of palazer plower poodle mixed a hooked dog and i ughtle a snowser poodle mixed hooddogh and a snow a snarlser poodle a snowser poodle mixedle mixed old dog and a snarlser poodle mixed old dog and a snarles or poodle mixed old dog and a snarlser poodle mixed old dog
go to classes so i always have a thrown up but mostly i dislike i twist it
maggie supermandled and so she would die she would inform
do and i cain't had one i ain't well last year i'm the boy who asked me i'm he was a junior so when
with a car so he called me and were at school one day and mum he was like i got in a car accident come down to my car and when oh got i got a i go in panic mode and look runnin down
and oh and then he was in the front seat and whose i can you look in the back trunk i'm to get a tool box and so
only differences her knees were pulled out of it to her chest
redecorating my house i am always being created by finding
tennessee wyomsen his beau for writing his wonderful
all its forms if i'm not doing a play or a picture i'm photographing or i'm writing
tennessee wyomsen his beau for writing his wonderful
have old friends that i rely on that our part of my life would have been for
and an it's about to have people relating an end trying to overcome
we haven't started yet and we were just beginning to talk about casting i was offered the part
than as i was reading it i started in visioning scenes on the night told the writer and the producer about the scenes i was investing and they liked it and elizabeth what are they directed and
filming alice does live here any more and the exercise opened in two sums so it was round my birthday so i threw a party for the cast and crew of alice
and i got up and followed her and she got to the top of the raft of the isle and she fainted and i went over to help her and i loose
and dale i remember one morning i left town
the first one i left town cause i was so excited about i thought i really must come down so i made myself take a drive and not was
i got home i had bouquets of flowers all over my door steps how impolite was
most of the times that i was nominated i was working and between so i i didn't well
but it's hard not to it kind of takes over your mind for
well i wasn't there i was on broadway in same time exterior
well they would let me off my joy but i i didn't think it was fair cause the people waited so long that it got tickets sometimes sir for months i had a time
it was fun er we were shooting in pittsburgh and i like pittsburgh very much and
wonderful person to work with and the rest of the cast two i love my daughter julian moore she said i think new exciting beautiful an
now it's a movie bout relationshipson there are too many of those around
and i'm i'm glad to see that i've got made and i hope
ah i stole it letters it wasn't the most successful will we edge it but i still get let
a music in their work shops and i'm on healing and on dying and a lot of people who told me that they were with their parents when they died because of having seen them all the end i think it's change people's attitude the people have been exposed to it a lot about death
m and i used to play always good mothers lately have been playing bad mothers and
now there are a lot of really wonderful actresses ah who are
because there are the rolls for them so i don't think there's a lack
you know it's not just that they're not running the parts i think it's the reflection of our culture that
when i made alice doesn't live here any more nineteen seventy four there warn't any films being made from a woman's point of view was a kind of water shed picture and i think that's changed or
actresses have taken it upon theirselves to make their own were
when you work in a film where you don't have much to do it's that's when you don't really nor to do with yourself you know when you have a a story where there's a lot happening and there's a lot of work on that's when it becomes very challenging and
we're all sworn to seek her sick we can't talk about it it's a space travel i think i can say that cyphi it's bis trabble i think i can say that cyphi it's baix we're all sworn to seek her sick we can't talk about it we're all sworn to seek her sick we can's it we can't talk about it we't talk about it we't talk about it all sworn to seek we can't talk about it we can't talk about it we can talk about it we can't talk about it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it we can's all swor all swor all swor all swor all sworn to seek to seek all sworn to seek we can'd to seek we can'd to seek
he added i was wonderful i'm a very lot of actors
think so i haven't seen it but i saw matthew a kind of hand the em it's i said it my still in the film cause i had such a small purlicat you said you're in it i've seen it it's great it's
i think i've been very good about getting my ambrose in mind what i want
ah but i don't think i've ever been called under really sacrifice
so i get to come and visit her my brother used to live near by so i came
just see him so i feel very at home here and then i hear that if the oldest filled festival i didn't know that in the
i had no idea that it was as popular as it is i mean only since it this season opened last week have i been getting reactions like have never got for anything i have ever done in my career i mean i can't walk my dog without
it is its hugely popular show and in the people
no i i never i did do don't now be one i'll see
because i have to watch so many shows for boding ah but i did watch a few of these shows and liked it very much but i had no idea that it was when it is to people which is the star
wracked out though i have a a scrip called bathing slow billet just love and i want to act in it and direct that's a new challenge have been poured to and you know we're in the process of raising money which is the hardest thing very
that she felt inside that she needed to express to test herself
the priests who were working in the film were very active on the set of blessing the set and with us and we were
and ah they're both really wonderful films and i've learned my tell a concierges will be a
too that's life and i'm just having the best time i've ever had my career one work every day in having a steady
it's nicely back to tell the show with such good riding and good
inexperience on its own we saw the film for the first time in its entirety
the fans of scott pilgrim and that just was so overwhelming that we got to sit there together as a cast and kind of experience it for the first time in that environment you know because you're there with people who are really passionate about the project in the
they wanted it to be dead and they were and it was it was the reception was amazing they loved it they laughed all the reports
it got supposed we were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was what was most important as that we were we didn't feel that we were holding four in objects in our hands and
was really imported and dumb key to asking able to start a deliver the koryogagagagacogagagagagagagagagagagagagagam key to asking able to start a deliver the koryogacogae to and dumb key to ask was really important and dumb was really imported and dumb key to asking az really imported and dumb and dumb and dumb key to asking able to asking able to asking able to ask for it was really important and ported and ported and port at and port at and dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb and dumb key to asked and to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask to ask for it and ported and ported and ported and ported and ported and port at and port at and d' and ported and ported and dumb and dumb and
and that with the help of the amazing stanteen we just i hope
yeah i i wish she's kin pine because don't you know i think it's really cool that she's a girl drummer and she's jest cunning there she observes everything and she's just
er ugh anything that's a school because you know i guess it's certain in a way opposite of knives
she's just so involved with everything and chemists sort of she sits back and can't just takes an end and
yes well i mean even right go going right into shooting for i hadn't had an
fit monyan and he was still you know going through thy
and then i think it was during production we got to read that and then this expects just
it got supposed we were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was what was most important as that we were we didn't feel that we were holding four in objects in our hands and
i'll go there and remind me a lot about rich sir john hugh's films i'm in a way that the certain huntsomble paths coming of each story and i think that's what's really great we'll stop
being able to play knives he said you could weaken just i could just stir up let loose and allow myself too purely and
you know like it as to show that fun that is also
she was and obstinate for herself and to really know what it is that she wanted in her life
were in a lovely note to alma sophia or on miss carrie ranch us to those with sweden i know
i wanted to see growing up that i never really got to see grace the screens i'm some one who
different life at home and she's chinese american and dab
carried dires and the writers of the entire teamland ah behind the scenes on the show r have been really great
minnow happens every one in this where when everything is a sort of a big
owner were not trying to be successive at sea but again we do have a lot of m the old the old the old the old the old the old the old the old the old the the only
one of them worked also on the sex in the city so i'm but we do have the support of that and then putting in their import too writing
it's a it's been a blast just working on the show a m it's essentially a precocal to sex in the city all the same craters on board canys bushnow wrote the book and now it's a tedicio and we're really excited about it it's essentially carey bratshaw in her formative years so it
i'm out and i ask canvas wish now that and she was just very nonchalant about it as just one of those things that kind of stuff she had a friend and they can't start at calling her mouse for some reason and so i i think it's sort of the same thing i mean with her with that with mouse into the carriderries she's got this sort of a' of way of kind of figuring things out if she plans everything that she plans everything you's everything you's everything you's and for me she's and for me she's in for me she's and for me she's in for me she's and for me she's and for me she's and for me she's in for me she's
of a mouse in a way so and plus she gets to world he's like really fine mouse pins i'm on all of her i'll fence so she's a different mouse pin for every outfit so that's also a reason why that she has a nickname but she's also i'm carrie's loyal supporter friend a
realizes along the way that that's not exactly the best way to ill of your life so
dust and life and life would be so bland without romance you know it's love is what we need it's what we hate but also
m sex in the city left such a legacy you know and i hope that we can bring on the same fans but also nourishing develop new fans for this show because it's also gear towards a younger democratic but it's also taking a great character a woman who was just so confident and unique and o k and had a great sense of self and was
measured in film and television i'm and kindleer the business side of it and worked on
and i'm and then after i've been a school that's when i was like a pay now is my time to really kind of
and put it on screen how do you share it with the world ah and that to me was always fascinating so i'm after i've finished school the finishing of birthday i decided to just i actually quit all my jobs and my parents i was crazy because i had a job off our two after school and i was like no one i'm not going to do it like what's but it's but what's to put it what's i had a job off our two after a job off our two after school
they just couldn't fathom the fact that i didn't want to be working but i was like but i am working i am additional
so i mean i think it's up it's a kind of hard for people to
i'd understand it first but i mean for me it was something i really needed to
i'd understand at first but i mean for me it was something i really needed to pursue
she's called me up and said ah there's this really great role you should go out for so i put myself on tape at first ah we didn't have to much time to a kind of check
ah what pratcho and panareti cry out out and tile in that bar room you what they kind of put out there it's just amazing nothing
of it's a film but it seemed time i think it's a piece of art because it is so much coming at you visually it's
you know asserted this uninhibited girl she's just so much fun and full of energy and as she's just got this genuine love of life and so that was what initially attracted me to her and then after i remember cosette's habit when i first additioned for her and for the roll that's kind of the sight of nice that i had to show and then when i looked in
you know well she's really cool cause she's got some besides turned you get to really sort of sear growth and so i thought that was real
oh no shooting nets that you know that time we were shooting that scene too is fine because we got to start up to the concert
we couldn't help but keep laughing so i remember like it was it took us so
i think it was really important for all of us to to have read the series before getting into the shooting part of it because i'm we tried to stay so you know trudo brilyum
just about had his own carbine islands not once but three times three times memories of parliament proposed anna
her first time going through it you don't mean so you're getting the purest most uninhabited feelings ever being shown to you and i think that's what makes her different different from you and anything that's what makes her different different different different different from her first time going through it you know me so her first time going through it you don't mean so you't mean so you're first time going through it you're first time going through it you don't mean so you't mean so you't mean so you're first time going through it you're first time going through it you're first time going through it you don're first time going through it you don't mean so so you don't mean so you't mean so you're first time going through it you're first time going through it you're first time going through it you don'
struck and you'd like he'd like take me and be like to get master so by the time you get here only to the first one
yes oh absolutely no i've been writing some scrips for the possible years and
you know the removal i have come on when to make i wrote this scrupled shack and it's as like this movie teased with some one location and i just thought it would be fun to make for it like no money with some friends you know get him you get a make a movie before you make a movie and as
you know you can make something on a superlate superlude budget small carroll with
a cerebral really made struck by the sense of adventure in my morning
you're an annually delicate got to know that period that well but one of the joys of our working with angli is that his beautiful mind in his kind of obsession with every little facet of the detail of the period really rubs off on every one else and you really find yourself learning a lot more about a
then you ever thought you would and now with something that had happened with me and i found myself really young now consuming
material that he would give me in all out of the different d v d and he sent me probably
the heath ledger had and broke back mountain that i really liked and that was the performance i hanged also directed so there were somethin for some o that you know billy's not a gay character but there was there was something about the kind of internal conflict
the dear hunter where i was like oh that's a great moment that maybe billie could
it's the sound of the gun that like puts you in that state it's hard to it's hard to think that without actually knowing what it sounds
seems to kind of have that snap quick aware in his reaction cause before i've i remember i tried it and rehearsal before i
those little subtleties that may be a lot of the people in the audience when they watch if there's if it's not there they won't consciously know but what ang is so when it was part of his genius is filling in all
question marks to where when people watch it it just has this feeling of kind of honesty and perfection and truth
to his success with their work it just shows a you know a discipline and a passion and a rigor that is only beneficial in my opinion
if not more conversation just about what kind of shoes billy should wear how
you know that's just an example of the kinds of details that we were talking about you know and we would have hours just talking about what kind of a kind of person billy was we would create old stories in our minds about who billy was and what had happened to him and why he feels a certain way and
i decided love to a mina because i i am very similar in the sense that i love to obsess about my character when i work on
when it was actually really really spare i think anna paul and i were both really prepared and ready to go but i
we knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes but they still had like a fresh just connote just out just out of the scenes but they still had like a fresh just connote just out just out out just out of just out of sight we knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes we knew the material enough to where we knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes we knew the material enough to where we knew the material enough to where we could perform the material enough to where we could perform the scenes we knew the material enough to where we could perform the material enough to where we could perform the scenes we knew the we knew the material enough to where we knew the material enough to where we could perform the material enough to where we could perform the we knew the we knew the material enough to where we could perform the we could perform the material enough to where we could perform the we could perform the we could perform
each exactly the tone of the scenes cosette you want a capture that naturalism where people watch and the like oh i believe these characters i believe these are real people i like these guise but at the same time you know you want a bee
and stuff like that and sometimes there is moments where it goes against being a hundred per cent and i
an exciting connoisseur experience you know with the excite by action
in just the setting of moss cavern and this kind of different visual language with the three d that people haven't only seen and i think kit's getting it also be pretty scary you know i think hopeful
you know the best elements of of jaws in that kind of where whereas this creature where is the singer i hope we can bring ah some of that to the screen and i think that that'll all make up for a pretty good time
a a little they told me that olivia was already attached and that was deftly a really big ah
fluents on me warning to do the film i'd really liked a lot of her performances and i thought she was just a really liked lot of her performances and i thought she was just a
had seen her in a couple and a potsino in a play with crispine who had really good
north and i'm on a really like your performance sir and i liked her in juno
i just thought it would be a m it be pretty fun to to work with an actor who's never really made a movie like this
away and she's been having a real interesting time and just kind of adapting to this like
i don't know why it works but i know when i feel like it's not working my
film and the opportunity to get a work with him and he's made so many classic films over the ears and
he's just a not only is he a great director but he's just a hilarious wonderfully
i had only of a repleted character that was probably as a moral in a certain sense
but at the same time it sounds really dark but there's also you know this dark humor too
think that everybody's got you know the their lightsides in their dark sides and their good days in their bad days so you know it's kind of examining the texts and
a reversion of it and a studying that part you know there's so much of that that moral ambiguity in the kind of it you know he's so conflicted about weather not to
people and who does he love and who does not love and i think that that really helped me when it came when it came
you know where i wanted the guys i grew up with i'm you know i lived in a m the panga kell
a which is kind of a kind of rural a community and in others times where i remember i been a
it wants you or kind of you know in that environment for long enough you know that the trailer becomes its own
there is a lot of a veno new wants to it and there is the horizon
i had worked with a m un into the wild and the character i portraitd in the film christmas careless had donated his life savings before he went on this kind of exodus that he did a tox fame america the oxford famine relief at the humanitarian adore organization and they had asked me when the film came out if i'd be interested in going to go to humanitarian ad organization and they had asked me when the film came out if i'd be interested in going to find me to find me to find me to find me to find me to find me to find me to get in going going going going to go in going to get a humanits a to an a toy and a d't with ad worked with a d's ad with a mced with a mced with a mc with a m a m a m a m a muitarian a m

the freedoms they have the luxuries they have while everything you everything you have that you take for grannie take tap water for granted you know i was staying in you know one of the nicest hotels in the congo and they verily had running water when i was there you know and then we went to another part and i talked to a guy who was

out racing you know in america everybody has a car so everybody can skunk a bee speed in a weird way in order that one of the dangerous parts about the addition process for me was i'd get into the character of speed and like starting about it and i'd be like driving home after the others
missus shawn pend and i know it wasn't a crank full of color because i'm pretty good with voices and
an extraordinary book i don't know ah if you goes of reddy into the wild by john crackhouse a phantom

living out of a tent out of homeless shelters hitchaking everywhere but he was he was very smart in a red this very sophisticated philosophy like tolstoy and thorough which fueld it and his ultimate adventure was to go into alaska and live off the land with almost no supplies which he did for he did for was to go into alaska and live off the land with almost no supplies which he did for he did for he did for he did for
remembered for a really long time you know this is to me one of the greatest
ay ay ay watch cartoon that work they will read run in it so i would always be watched to speed racer grown up i'd watch it with my cereal and i'm pour the soot in
kicking and screaming on the floor as my agent looked down in disgust and then you know you just
a huge robatic arm that can like you sit on it and there's like a seat and it just thrashes you around and can spin your on and if nearer is the movement of a car and it's on a green screen background that's notches and it gives you whiplash
that looks real i mean the effects in this movie are god
ahem he would show me some art work and belike who gave this as woods can have
in servant of driver all my friends were laughing when i got the part as they all know me is like the granny
was like the most amazing actor you can ever be around me you're just so riveted by his every movement any
ah you know i've i was i felt that i wanted to come and get an accountless i wanted to be true to who he was as a person you'd advantages throw the character out the window and do my own interpretation or anything
kind of touches upon us something that exists within us all you know that that yearning cussford
into the wild with such a long hard shoot that i think i just went in to speed racer o the long shoot that i think i just went in to speed racer o the long hard shoot that i think i just went in to the wild of such a long hard shoot that i think i just went into the wild of such a long hard shoot that i think i just went into the wild with such a long hard shoot that a long hard shoot that i think i can the wild of such a long hard shoot that i'll long hard shoot that i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i can get such a long hard shoot that i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i can get such a long hard shoot that i think i can get such a long hard shoot that i think i can get such a long hard shoot that i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i think i
on two story and at just stone really struck a corded man it seemed like a character that i never really played you know i wasn't used to playing a tough guy er ever even
and it was very complicated a psychologically now i was trying to let on but not too much too much more psychologically you know i was trying to let on but not too much too much too much too much a og and it was very complicated a og and it was very complicated a og and it was very complicated a og and it was very complicated a og and it was very complicated a og and it was very complicated a psychological and it was very complicated a psychological and it was very complicated a psychological and it was very complicated a psychological complicated a psychological a psychological a psychological euxcomplicated a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychologically nog and it was very complicate in it was very complicated a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychological a psychological ez very complicate i was very complicated a psychological a psychological a psychological
my favourite scenes a it ended up being that way but i remember those i warn't the first takes they're like action and i just liked disliked like those i warn't the first takes they're not a action and i just liked a slight dislike but i remembered those i favored scenes a it ended up being that being that way but i remembered my favourite scenes a it ended up being that being that way but i remembered up being that way but i's on my favourite scenes a it ended up being that being that way but i remembered up being that way but i remembered up being that way but i remembered up being that i remembered up being that i remembered up being that way but i remembered up being that way but i but i remembered my favourite scenes i remembered up being that i remembered
that it gets people a lot more self conscious about the
he was like art will let's see how bad he wanted to this you're not giving you the roll you train at this pro camp that i selected and broke him for athletes six days a week six a m you
five six hours training a day which is insane and
marcus is a very intelligent man and a very detailed oriental person and he wanted nothing less than absolute
sending credible story in a great monument to men and women in uniform and people who serve and people are willing to make those sacrifices and they should be appreciated they shouldn't get lost in the twenty four seven new cycle that we have these days works i can hear about some about on the news and two days later not even in your mind you
this is a chance to really a appreciate a really special group of people that a have made some huge sacrifices for people that are have made some huge sacrifices for vices for vices to really a appreciate a really a chance to chance to really a appreciate a really a a a chance to chance to really a appreciate a really specialist a really a really special group of really specially a really specially special group of really special group of really specially a really special group of really special grouper a really specially specially specially special group of really specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially special group of really specially specially specially specialist or really specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially specially special
his great confidence he's so much confidence he's a great man
a kind intelligent person who i really really admire and a
he knows how to he knew how to navigate the relationships of all the family
had fallen in a really genuine respectful way where people didn't feel it and no one was being short changed or taken advantage of or anything like that they really supported pete they got behind
and they like it so it's like conall ignition accomplished a little bit we sort of field as i know for p
who people he wanted to like the mood he told me that before we've been shy said thus all their matters
you know i tried to just learn as much as i could about em you know through the family i got a meat with walton billy mc kanless chris's pair
you know try to read a lot of the philosophy that chris was reading at the time you know those walled in by
and endah your essays and poems by ralph waldo emerson so there was that kind of philosophical background and a the call of the wild by jack london was really
and now that wander less that exists within us all that i feel as one of the big
to the to the book and now the film you know if mc kinley's head had in a personal problems and just ran off next door and you know built train sets no one would have
not his clothes his watch he had a gold watch that he gave to jim galleon wynjim galleon let him off on the stampede trail fourteen years before and in the film jim galleon plays himself dropping me off under the stampede
came to set and he actually had a goal watch that christmas careless had given it to fourteen years before so he
me i'm the gold watch cause he thought i should wear it so i had the gold watch
he just viewed alaska as the biggest challenge on his plate you know us
poor survival he no poor independent survival that he wanted to test himself to challenge himself on the hardest train he could find now to him was allowed
ah well you know i just tried to play him for who i thought he was and how you know if people feel that way there more than entitled and welcome to feel that way you know there's nothing wrong with feeling like that i don't think er that's just a perspective on him i don't
no i don't i don't feel like i a short changed or a you know gave mc candless a foam booted phone book to sit under
all he noted cunning raise him up oh i don't think that any that was going on and we do
make him look better than then he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was false
make him look better than then he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was false and now that now he was
rest in the races and he supported by his wonderful family ah the racer family
only skin of the cracker jack knew kind of mavrik on the track racer ah and all the big corporate conglomerate corrupt people want to come a sign of it
i am a motchleyum really hyper aware of how dangerous driving is like all the time
it was only sixteen days prince avalanche was just a very fast
i think that sometimes some of these smaller movies words they don't have enough money to have a big action sequences or necessarily like a a lot of plot are later locations
so that's that's always a benefit for the actors getting it more more more stuff to play and
benefits to the audience i guess such as depends on what the audience is looking for you know if you want to have a couple of laughs and a really enjoyable time see if
i think that this is like the perfect movie free to see you now i'll be sleeping when i see like a robe on him that must trouble
yet are amping which is when you are practising your music but you can
you know they always say that you know when you have a child i'm my blowing experience but he always hear that then of course
in the twenty twenty episode when i was just a kid when i was about eight years old i saw the the twenty twenty episode about into the wild and christmas palace and it always stuck
he used to fire ball of a guy so to get it called from him as kenneth
they're scarcer than they would seem ah when you'd when you actually get up close to
integrity of the authenticity went whereon whatever he re re re re re relenticity went wherever on whatever he rewree
so we would go to all those realizations that christmas candles really went to you know if there's a scene where i'm going down a river naked and ice water i would be naked in a river
the mentality of the shoot but the whole crew we all really we all bonded as a family we got into it
you'll take the risks that the film required but always to be cautious
it presses their sounds come out so i hit it and it was literally a guy saying lines i had in the moon
defining moment where i fell like music held me out ah yeah
the defining moment was probably when my mamma used to sing me nursery rhyme
i mean i think that though i mean this is it's kind of a strange answer but and
so when i made the film like i was very i convardy knew a lot of that hippy coal churn and a lot of that whole world
it was to seek a music festival kind crafts and all the
managed the novelty of that and a sense but it was also like a
like zumin on my crutch and some take but every
yes and it stayed with me forever i was five and i was doing valet and my parents were watching and i fell flat my face i
any other i was saying like when all the men might have their clothes on them they're all dancing you know when they do
amazing cause i actually visited a children's hospital and it really could have until you see you know first and first hand watch it goes on in the incredible people that raise money for these sorts of things it really really really could have hit home how important these
why to say it's its mother singed until you see it first time
lest you if you don't have that kind of a trouble in your life you don't know how important it is rarely until
so important is so important to support best and and yet these are the people the are important that they're just incredible people

you how excited i am i am such a huge branch van huge wreckage bay's fad i think he's a genius i think i think he's a genius i think
i'm changed the history of comedy with david bryan er he created a whole new kenneth john roan hold you whole new mannerisms and ways that people speak to each other which i find fascinating m change the history of time there goes david bryan i must remember to thank
because there's something so endearing about it i think the thing about great comedy as they've got to have a real heart to it and i think when somebody makes that much of a fool of themselves and but they think they're smashing it that's to think they think they're nailing it they think that every one likes they think they're really cool and actually cool and actually behind their backs we's we'll blow
so i think it yea i think it's quite endearing and i think people like that i think that's what makes him so likable even though he's a let she old far people that gets everything wrong i think people really really root for him because it is endearing and he's just trying to be powers with every one who's duty he knows he's trying really hard and he's
when you're dealing in it in a tramiss ender i late at night you're going to get everything right because any good old gun shot victims you go your people have been in an eye intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at night time i'm in that
any a lot of bad accidents people are tired of the drunk drivers with all its stuff and you're so getting at the rain even get the dregs of society all the way to tops who's coming i think a whole vast spectrum
it's pretty well because andy's right away we ran the negro commerce and we got called eliot somewhere during in our way at some stuff outside when it went a guy falling on a tree branch and then mercer's been dealing with other stuff as well so it's pretty specific and it's pretty real and they've got a science to raise i've done microbology and bio camerap i was a pain in the airs and i's a pain in the airs i's i's i've done five and i've done live a nice i've done five and i've done five and i've done five and i've done five and i've done five o've done five o've done five o've done five o've done five o've done five o've done five o've done five o'
the basic i speak of it but they're very race pacific about this as they can do things and so that's taken a little time to make sure we get it right because no point it's not my doing it in a husk with you to do wrong
say it's hard to wear anywhere in any arm and those those those pajama type clothes may it's difficult because you got the underwentery underwentery underwentered underwentery those those those those those those those those those those those pajama type clothes i's i'd tied hard to are to are to are underm ate made hard to are underground to are underground to are under wear anywhere underware in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere in any arm and anywhere on me those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those those thos
dram a film afy to myself and tom hoppers two brothers
it's a drama drawn from m a section of john steymics
because it is quite a sprawling plot that an offlet happens and things are start to recur and i don't want to give way too much after trust me that it's
various rewards and terms of copies of the scraps i get from the screening
connection be in the film itself to need lectures and certain scenes who can see to myself and tom operan and m if you goes when it comes along at the grate
in herself because it is it is where most movy takes place and it becomes this kind of vis
dark new ones is of of a psychological aspect of the peoples
is not a character in it and it's just really we scare it and when i read it i was i this is his kind of messed up and then we read it and it's messed up then it's gone and we can better next you see it i did
for studs poor mercedes and he said can i buy a foot bobbets and i supply me as my need a for an addition as i can pay for poor thanks and now i can s'coke it if you can my bits i can come i guess i can find so i came along additioned and there paul gave me the part and then i was in my finals and college well as own studs of friendly glee's and did will mark's
the very start i almost took brady's head off and i came out blood a bruise knuckles that come and take me down ago none of so you don't have to kill me as it none of this is fun cause you can't feel like any one to proper fight when you rise
very annoyed at each other because i felt that he was messing up he thought of i was messing her i wended up getting really into and almost killed each other for half an hour or a litry doing this fight was very serious he's only cunning and for half an hour or a lichetr very annoyed each other each other each other each other each other each other because i felt that he felt that he was i felt that he was i felt that he was miss i felt that he was mes messss messsssing nothing nobody thought that he was messsss mes nothing of mes nothing of messssssing up he thought that he thought that he thought that he thought that he thought that he thought of mes nothing of messsssssing up he thought of mesing
i am i'm not sure i i was soon a talk of anything called charley casanova which has commands from your least in january and february for which
i asked his love everything to do it entertained to do it film and i just think i am i think he can as a director as a semi
none of us much controlled about it and it is a different it's a different way working and i had but the same time at all the same thing as
yes monsieur d'artagnan that's a very good example i think i think it is because he get experience being uncertain and being with people and can have got again
thing and then you get to kenneth m you're more aware i've had to tell a story i think if you were
you're more aware i've had to tell a story i think if your workin says an acton you see from it a prospect of me at people take you
i have no idea i think i joined drama because and was loder
she did the same track m for the first film i directed christian blake which was least and she did the censure for that and una did allowed a music for it at a documentary forty some
and they come from germany and australia and austria just to come down like she watch you film and assure them this scene is as magnificent counsel and its scandal have been in a fairy tale and you sit now franz missus greate instead of an holiday and then there are two touring the people
all day and then there's my two turn of people staying there just watching you do you see
rainy nights is almost like doing theatre anyway and you're doing this scene and in our and under a watching the robbery sweet aunt's kind of thing
i think we'd do as i've a really interesting take and the whole itherion tails and a gown the camelot air and that kind of thing and they've done a lot o that's kind of stuffed
few of those things before and i think we'll do a lot as i've fun with it
it's the jamieson embarrass sixty second competition which myself and jim shared with his wonderful adjudgeon and he did at last your and it's it's either the cobbleiers
dignisco and i which are made to make a really interesting thing and some one like jim has gone to see it and a friend of mine did at last year and anna girl acted in one of the pieces that didn't win but jim as she saw and then wanted to meet her just
and at its great opportunity to sense in the overnail marshal was on at last journey judges at the end of the cave
north new mexico and that's getting released in the cinema and january we just fed out and yesterday
you know it's actually awful because i was ready ready ready to cool in some money for the people and i got to meet the guys who'd made rack
only skies who attack these discrepable women at these group of girls and in this supernatural creature carries up the highest the crescendo of the violence for a man to man than the native energy place he brings in a creature which has
eh cause she know it was because you got to look at from an acting point of view seeing where it went with these different these different people home disguise and the girls but also because i wanted to explore where
some supernatural creature would come from and what whether in a weather the drawers a disparity between the good person a bad person whether like a ghost or a creature would just kill everybody and i was a greater like comfort than i should come from negative energy lest
when i best may teach brilliant i've put it there as grind fortune it was not a regular friend of mine all three of us worked together quite a
a sentrysis of obol were a gnatley vernascentz of ozo got like five or six
i don't need to see wealthy with anything else more which tried to do was to submit a drama and it were relations
i don't need to see my uncle with anything simple we tried to do was to forbid a tram and it were relationships and snaps
there's no full out time to see a break down of some machine of latship and then yet we've something rougher happens and brings people together had the deal of a situation struggle any can a drama does when he get that cross all the time in the horror she learns to see people in these extreme circumstances and sees what people react what they'll do
the biggest thing i mean cause and also those newspapers very clever fellows and also looks society and looks so trying for the people of relations it's not just about a harfield it's an awful amber
i'd like to make my feelings away in any simple end you can make entertainment and an also trying of something through it even for three subtle examinations from beer i think
can explore i think it's important sometimes suits lore the native aspects of society and people psyche
i've put a number for a canceling on my wet side and then if you want to go to that person and give out to me i
i was really excited because i thought the polar created a character that it was really interesting to me and it was quite dark and quite laird and then i went how caressing have i really wanted
doc's character now i think what poll does really cleverly is paul paul's as she can't he understands the games in a way where that's was able to create the world so well but he's done things sometimes these created characters himself to fit for harry once to move his to go it is what he did with allison when he doubled it with but with my character so
some moments to some moments when you count like you know going out some carters and the and you kind of gone i remember this and suddenly is jumping at it you're like it getting over to peatesty flashbacks making fifteen years old and in my
a lot we shot in in in the rain in the darkness we had two or three hundred ac
hilarical hieroglyphic great stunk i nathan nathan bears to do the great job but at the same time when everything is silly coming at you you're kind of a little bit like coming out of tell sapling so's moments when everything's those these big fence is not always a trying to get through and you've a big idea where your mark supposed to be let the same time it's instinctive to just figure
that we had wed one or two foam things only because we are doing stuff for you jumping off
just as a stove or kind of rolling around you get the foam one but that's more than that he don't break the prop that way you it is done not to fix the proper fun of smash
i said home at steub eh i just want to keep failing himself whenever it be called caught eyes one to fill everything was going on
these armies are cabin coffee and just talking about the weather as severe as it to know the atmosphere they create on set melon pole have a great energy about the money just make it
and conservoir the old and tender and experts and snares and encombed were sixty four north south southern own playing games and ice plated
one to watch because a canner has everything in it and has a movie i think for me at personing the best one and it gets just ties of any together so i think much as move if you have much to the five if you have what to the five
first soon was like the start of alexander's queen back into kind of to move a making i think as they had to lub a
for me because i was just meaning that the movie the precious old amelian paul so for me i was a kind of doing my thing and just cunning i noticed that there just be except by then hoping to come to do a good job but it's afterwards when you realize how important it is to lot a people
good polro descripts i think me there is like the action star for me for like the last fifteen years and paul
eh they just made me feel very welcome as if i had it's a very chill vive the free intense because we're doing as these crazy sequences and it's a crazy big set and they make it really chill and impal the meal i have their daughter ever in the movies well and alleys when they're for a while so it's a very nice
they did stake up a couple of the crew with guns and he wanted me to meet any of the people intact figure them a
he has his great way whereby he's doing these and cradell behooed sequences he's got this whole movie mapped out in his head and he just makes it very chill i he i never saw em once gets dressed he just makes the whole thing very easy
it almost feels like it cause what we're doing was so hectic and so not sometimes a scope for to be so enjoyable and relaxed almost seems like a
in a way with t c being suspended so come back in season two he still spent suspend of the start
to being brought up back into the hospital these is all sometimes aware they have breaked down ah and he ended a talking a lot of his issues and going through a china deal lot on which jordan so started the
look after the peoples himself which is his way of dealing with his own demons and exercising what happened to him upon
he's very complex because he's also a darkness to him which i think is what people connect him with everyone's got that kind of darkness
to a he's turning hard to do with that to cope with all these things happened to him from being in a canistan with his brother and that's heart and i think that's he's a very human character and he's a
i owe the characters ready er re identifiable because they're all real they're all real people he got it's the way that they've come of created the characters i could drew and ago said and i'm told for that the real people who can't be care about in the carp you know m
it's always much easier to come back to do second season because you know everybody and so you can count a messer and people more in you understand their foibles than that evelyn is a different one might count a messer and people more in you understand their foibles than that evelyn is a different one as a different one as a come back to you second season because it's it's always always always always always always always always always always always much easier and it'er and it's much easier and he'er and he's much easier and he's much easier and he's much easier and he's much easier and he can back to come back to come back to come back to do second sees a second season because you second season second season because you's a second season because you'
any any of you get each other because in you don't even have to act any more after time because you just be like talk of your friends
fabricating something it's like we understand each other we know who we are i never know to the characters are unknowns evans can have fought
fun right but it's fun but this also as a lot of kind of humor to it but then it's quite energetic and which are these re important and it's quite real and all the character
sucked into symmetrical the time and has come of light in the low bed and it was down again as love of intensity to it so is em does lot a kind energy with it and i think that's the fund aim at the show is because it's always got a good pace to it nuts or make
thought i knew little bet not but all these books to learn but we do some really really really interesting stuff i do in ackmost all the all these things he wouldn't normally
so any up you like john fogg and he's worked in me off for years so you do learn about a loss if they wouldn't know about otherwise which is
movie was in association to be asked with you i at the very first day that they threw me on set and we had to speak speak spoken of free paid scene in its in a word this mass of sadness gone when i to do all the style of a deal i went to canna get with
great stunk i called nathan barracy's fantastic and did all like a lotus that often shows such a dominion in stuff so he was he was really on top of it and but they let me do
or selfly coming in after of the air the degradings enough
stuff and yea easy he is a oh the most of unless it cans like very very very fine details stuff they let me do a larva but nathan was great because he oversarmed
i really want to do these stunts and eh i won't get me do it and anyhow there's two in the people who if i break my finger or myself we have to change the same so it's not about you know
she's beautiful right when i i remember that ef i'm in when you see me then fifth element
earle originally vouches she's beautiful and she's still beautiful and she's just the most wonderful person she's a wonderful actress i just i i had a
crates that vibe on sat where she makes it in o ev'ys
i don't get set to my geek i can't even get it when much you go and threw a cone through our port security or going to emigration in american and american and american americans through our port security or going to emigration in america and america and america and america and don't get set to my y gaek i don't think i don't think i don't get it't get it't get sut get set to my way i don't get it so too i don't i don't i don't get it so too i do i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't get set to my get even i don't i don't i don't i don't think i don'
ada and ada i used to get ready word on terminoration america was your cousin's make it all very serious and
texas my bodies and i told them as can be playing other larders love interests they were quite jealous because
like a nicheft a we start in a two months i'm doing move you the body mine and about three weeks and
is only submitting at this top in the tail of the finger as if it is all shot so quenchly from start to finish and
granary listens to him i think ever tell me enough at i direct him we have
explore that you don't have to waver other things and then because you understand each other's actress i'd know what to direct
do not secretly allow people to be free and then see what their characters are going it wouldn't work
that's the kind of height of what man can do to no man and then i want to see
i was likely to say by keeping its attention so when it i wanted to forget real reactions over them is very real so because we didn't quite at night otherwise like to be like to be like to be liked to go in actions over to his very real so because we didn't quite at night i was like to get really like to get really your saying by keeping its attention so when i keeping its attention so when it's so when it's i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i was i would your saying by keeping it said to say by keeping its attention i was i was i was i was i was like keeping it so glad to keeping it to keeping
dislike for what has happened an end for himself he does not care that for teasing us in point
he is to have an outlet to focussarts and think of even though betting may be because he is spending so much time looking after the people he actually needs to be able to
i can like to be raised doing a real life working for twelve footing house it would be stressful
following certain regulations he is for straying for him because it takes time and he doesn't like
of the small group of rebels who were conscious of a barely surviving in a coon city and through exhausted and as a lot of in inner fighting and little factions of elping and east just to make heapings together and along a claret felt and he sir the two of them were romantically intertwined and their kind just about surviving and doc his air when me there are alas turned to ar ar austernae
never like to me eh why you know ikey i think he cannot doc looks he's east he's reluctant leader and that he's looking after everybody but at the same time as
it was quite humbling however and it then ever made me feel very special in her honor in his time was a really nice group of people and i didn't have some portrait of doing maybe that's come that's this importantness alas when the franchise and says big you cannot one or could be
you know and so you know your work in long hours and it's difficult miss toff but if you get on the people and
like morgan to do the singer that's the another better at my m but if he can get away with it
the older fortune is all that's all that's cuts cut off what being an actor is in your head i had it's
or these actors from sylaphica who were made up as his armies and they am when you have a crowd of group of people at nighttime surrounded by fire and there all done up as armies and their whole mandate is to try and kill
in the lack of becoming a lover freaky because it cuminates through the grating
just reedy like inspired by time of man my child because he booked really hard and inspired by a mound for what she those now she worked by my sisters everybody you know by my grannie
last question in the amountue section have you ever had any funny encounters with fair
a quicker and from all the places you went to what was a favourite place to shoot and why
if i most act as i find why not do a character and i'll part of it because you
are you going to be directing starring an aim or movies or projects in the near few
will you be reprising your role at grain in season five this question is from loose she would
great great that's wonderful i cannot wide wait for a greater a i for one i cannot weigh
i am quite glad about that personally i quite glad next question do you like to travel and have you ever gone to any exotic places from eleanor
that there was a big ice in shooting at nighttime which was annoyed i thought no mexicansman be hot this is cold this is as like as bad as bad as bad
who is the business of the episode doctor of the hospital i am an intendant of the episode doctor of the hospital i am an intendantantine and who who who is the business of the episode who who who is the business of the episode of who is the business of the episode of the episode of the who is the business of the episode of the episode of the episode of the doctor of the
and this incident with the little boy and the car accident is the
though monomaniac fact was kind of starts the lot of their clash between the two of them and then george and his canada the counterpoint between all
and could you have to treat as a business or what such cunning that's the fundamental core of this episode
in combat situations and dealing with life and dead situations if you got somebody in a suit telling what to do you know i listened there you don't listen anybody's in a suit telling me to do anyway but er so in that's that's the fundamental reason we don't get on and then we're going to see what to do and teach you doesn't agree with them because for two sees about saving lives and how would everything else and how would ever the else what we go sir has to cheat we go sir has to do sir has to do to do says a bit with us make our two
because george is there in hushes engaged and so he got the whole excre i know guelfern boyfront i think on earth and they clash a lot but they still care about it
i late at night you're going to get everything right because a young girl gunshot victims eagerly if people'd been in in high intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at nighttime and that that's realistically when he allotted bad accidents people are tired of their drunk drivers with all its stuff and you're a spectre but it's all the m i means some of the society all way to tops who's going to tops was going to talks who's going to me i think ole i think o's going to go me i think ole that's got all d m i think ole that's got all d m i think ole
the characters have to approach the same way as life is too short and adding if you see people are dying in front of you will then you know you got a find of humor in it eventually you got a fine human everything else around you otherwise you know likes too more than a morose
place and pull suits of hope and just now chair out and just get away from everything
he all these heart and lungs enjoined as this great job are by this is perfect replicas of like an open hearted surgery of like someone spying us of that's vehicle you see like all this can a weird jam
delighted it is especially a mescollic mash meats yarre guest nasposus et cetera more high act than version of of it of a doctor shows not a canting ivor watched
it's very different because you're dealing in off lot a with but the night shift which has got very different type of of synos and would have in the day shift of hospitals i wasn't aware else i did it i'm
so it's its goddess great a mixture of m of dramah with
says myself with meg married to this sir this kind of i
i am a situation because you have all it do not go ready to the army and so in that sooner in that situation is a less bitter comedy to it like mashness in a lot of
m i play a practical tsi kellyn who is a an ex army medic who is enough canistan with
t c you know we e e suffered an awful lot from when he was in a
so tsi is is suffering off a lot from having been enough canister and always working in the yard the reason why he works in the yard in the night shift is because he still gives him the heavy working in the yard the reason why he works in the night shift is because he still gives him the thing that he sees is suffering off a lot from having been enough gasi is so tsi is is is suffering off a lot from having been enough to having been enough gasey is suffering off
dood who's very quick to anger but he's a very very race my doctor but he just does not like me and told what to do she likes to make things his own way
the character of t c is some one has been in the army but has always been a difficult to follow wars directly she's always tried to do his own thing and i'll actually let him be and being being being being being being tried to do his own thing and i'll actually led to him being and being being being being being being in the army but the character of t cyte of t c is some one is some one is some one is some one has been in the army but is been in the army but is in the army but is always always a character is always very act of tyte of t cyte of t cyre of t cyre of t cyperta of t c is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is some one is been in the army but is
added the army essentially because he wasn't always falling direct orders so in the yard t c's lib of a mabric in turns for you understands it to do things and he doesn't use your weight to be told what to do older still
as well but t c is always the one who canna go out and canna vem and tolfer to the ones who go in into the environment to it will be the rascalic after to bring people in and they leave the ae are an awful lot to canna bring impatience who are in trouble and self what they do they don't just stay
yes think we'll permit every episode so far as there is a big event and that's what's
interests me the light of there's a lot of intensely in the latter high obtained ram i got on but it still got this this lovely sense of patience this night and
and mc snamom's activity but behalfd she was teaching a pre nursing module
took over her course when i doubted to seek for three for once so i thought she taught with his stuff
not the unusual dish of toast of and blossom because of the snares it can create with
the army in so forth an evident it goes on at night time a psychical idea that in order to the full moon where it stuff happens rights what night time weirder still seems to happen in hosbook such more the crazy's command so it's already got though that extra element of craziness attached to any girl to the death of a deaf and a different level
source was quite fresh like mash in other men and mashes mid around for long times has got that comedy with the lot of drama with all action so it's does a lot of thing
shows not really like reason that many are because i'm but you are with him you are with a show mash from the adis i love master
you are them you are with a show mash from the aides i love master and on this shows more is more countersociated that because we've got the cana military aspect is also a lot of can of black humor and are shown to difference a brazen enemy in any hour to great shows what their more dramatic and ours has the drama but is got these different elements so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so it's so
the interesting is because he is always on the edge because he has been to war on his surface and
on a real guide a real character and in a we've a lot of military people worked with a show so m and it's a mirthy hospital and to all the cases i stuffed at acting efforts and i think this will also make the show in
kind of elements who at terms of all the cases and like the realist mind that
we say it is a bit chaotic and adeption sprynsford which we have lived to doctors are worth and said all the time
and man to the doctor so i spent some time with them and i brought lot of books of our lot of books i didn't read but i have them there so makes me feel
and and i think it's its interesting way to that weather medicine looking after somebody does become an actual business and takes way from the amount of human aspect color and that's cunning about the two fighting as because t see just wants to save people and does me to care about you know business and authority in all that kind of stuff and george does and she needs to look after the actual you know the paper work in the business aspect of it because otherwise the hospital will not work and that was does not work and that was does not work and that was done it was done every one that was done every day's does work then every day's does work that was done work that was done every day's does work then every day's done every day's done work and there was done everything it was done work and it is done everything it was done everything it was done everything it was done everything it was done everything it was done everything it was
he cannot does his own thing which is incredibly attractive to play is a
there is some part of the tract of to watch as you watch us along which is in i think it may seem comfortable to watch somebody just meeting care of which you don't come away rather than
if it feeds his own feelings of guilt so he has to deliver every single prisoner comes in
saving somebody's life because it's almost like saying in her own atmosphere it's almost like him saving part of his past because the things have happened to him so so saying part of his past because the things have happened to him so that he's like because he's almost like saving and somebody's like because he's almost like saving somebody's almost likely because he's almost like saving it's almost like saving it's almost like saying he's almost like saying he's almost like saying he's almost like saying he's almost likely he's almost likely because he's almost like saying it's almost likely because he's almost likely because he's almost likely because he's almost likely because he's almost
i hear you know somebody who is so halbett i'm doing the right thing and so help it on helping some one else more they're just incredibly certain or what they want to do that you ought a medically want to support them that night as well as it's and he's
and alexander and that is m a very destructively stupid and more so rigid than once with t c adding ashy for t c
a love is the friction embrowed to and so forth an e
and i'm afraid from a lot of people friend of my debate indeed i'll often get that and the same as our mis show is that we just happened up this really great group of people were by every one and the way they cast and put together is this really interesting because
yes i think so singing house go i think i'm the most important thing i think with actings i trust the other persons
from curfew and danny was the guy who am when i's decided
and of that acting and civil ministering sustaining misery and demi and myself in daddy's sermon

see every all the big parts everything have to dish in for it and use you might do a tape in the new england
vic er fit in properly because i i love the movies anna and i love to compute again so much to do justice but am it was paula mina might make me very easy you know paul gave me the room and the space to unexplor the character they wanted to and work on mere deliciousts it was
such as makes everything nice and simple you know so there's no it was a very calm it's a very intense shooting schedule every intense set was very calm yet it ain't a very intense shooting schedule a very calm it ain't it it just makes everything nice and simple you know so there's no it was no it was very calm it just makes everything nice and simple you know it was no it was no it was very calm it just makes everything nice and simple you know it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no it was no use everything nice and simple you know it was no it was no it was no it was
do that much citoyen i think the vast majority well to mean that there's joseph see a bit in terms of enhancing study how the vast majority was paul wanted to go back to shooting the way he would with everything in camera so he had all these conervity crazy locations i possessed of if he murmured that there really
that's all that's all like this not a set that's all this big building of johanne's burg it's an earlier
three stories away and none of that c g i and all the sets he'd be built in it or not to build they would find these real buildings rack them and then can a crete to set in there so a lot of it is just
anna at debts again i stuck out this memory which won't lead me which is because i failed to play the
in that bloody house and if to open doors and then some jumps say in you just go on to and even when you know you have
and you just go on to and even when you know you have to open the door and you know the thing has come from it just still it gets every time that is my very first memory of reason evil
gigame a lot of scope to come at about me in poland rate for anxious ideas of this character anyway so as can have easied me to come in and go cool em m he knew what he wanted for the character
but he he allowed me the freedom to come and just play with stuff and he trusted me because we shut a lot of it so so as i go away we're going to this is where i want the character to go to the end so he had to cut a trust me to let me play it that way until we got to the part of my part of the freedom to come and just play it my played me that way that way and he let me trusts me try to tell me just tell me play it that way until we let me trust to me trust to me to me to me to me trust to me to me

billion dollars said to use and it wasn't at our disposal as much as we would
yet rebecca was convinced we were having a boy a great little namer after my father
and that when we found out it was a girl i said great when they were after my father
i think probably i think we would have we would have to have him limping
uniting the first episode as kind of business as usual and then we slowly sort of regression and deal with
but i'm sure it was great i have a picture of it and i i was stopping while i met william covey was a great guy but you're

do i froze for a little bit and i started seeing you know recognizable faces and then you wonder what they're all doing in the same spot yet realize will this is for
a month for the first went to monte carlo and london i did some promotion for the show and we went to paris
we're kids young that's the back isn't real and a you know because
seasoned four was carnivora you know i throw back to the original graze which was you know a year before
i didn't i think i've stolen a shot i think i invitation still open so we'll see if i take it or not but er yes i felt a little
dedicated to isolating mark sloane at the end of the season leaving him with just himself
were it x though i'd firstly love katy we were great work
well yes i mean that it's hard to turn to tug or shelley guess not give too much a way but basedically i'm the future of america this another's heart bite
at the last minute before they die take over their body like jumping into a car before it was off a cliff and then we live their lives and it's it's a one way taken where not go back to the future
a premiss and some of the missions that we are here to take care of was worshipped or some of the way in some of the way of the missions that we are here to take care of was some of the way of some of the missions that we are here to take care of was some of the premiss and some of the missions that we are here to take care to take care of premiss and some of the missions that we are some of the missions that we are some of the missions that we are in some of the missions that we are hearings that we are here to we are here to take we are here to take we are here to tells that we are here to tells that we are here to take caren us and some of the missions that we are here to tells that we are here to tells that we are here to tells that we are here to tells that we are here to
i used sir however the first i was interviewed by people magazine night they asked me something about
clips just now to a packed room among four thousand people and the reaction was what we see now long which is the film's very very action was what we see no long which is the film's very very very just now to a packed room amongst four thousand clips just now to a packed room amongst its four thousand clips just now to a to a packeds just now to a packed room of one thousand clips just now to a two
surety i think so much of a sapphire air these days and
ah well paris which is what i was torn out is it very setting up so but i let's be honest we couldn't shoot in paris all seasons
knowing them rather what happens in paris and a and it's sir but because he and ginghamgan gingen and ghip ghisi but because he and gingingen gingen are not what happens in paris and a and it's a matter what happens what happens in paris and a and a and it's a matter what happens what happens what happens what happens in paris and paris and a happens in paris and a and a and a and a and a and a and it's what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens what happens in paris and a happens in paris and a happens in paris and a and a and a and a and a and a and a and a at it's what happens in paris and a and a at it's what happen
to call it the razor as a necessity coming in i was
it's a crime soldier show and i think he's getting a great fit on alibi i'm
but ah i was thirty five when i got one a grace so a minute
so a while i was working i was never famous i never knew i i
ears and okayers but i i i did a lot of guests are stuffed i did lot
if you have to do it but i don't know i have one thing i say is don't put all your eggs in one basket i don't find
explodes at our own images but from me said napoleon that that was when the earliest child once well we weren't thinking we were on a show that may be earliest toned once well we weren't thinking we were on a show that may make me our own images but from me said apollo as loud as i our own images but from these flowed as i our own images but from these flowed as i our own images but from our own images but from me said napoleon
and then he shouted at david's arroy a producer said that is simply public as my girth i can find your father a producer said that is simply public as my girth
explore more of that i mean i think that we start the second season with him on his medi
so i don't know how long that's can last but to it certainly will lend itself to to connecting more with
the with people on a romantic level i'm not sure but i think there's going to be little more than more than more than more than more than more than one not sure but i think there's going to be a romantic level a with people on a romantic level a with people a with people a on a romantic level au er with people a on a romantic level au on a un a romantic level au on a romantic level a on a un a romantic level a un a romantic level a un a romantic level a un a romantic level a un a un a romantic level a un a romantic level a romantic level a un a un a unromanticle on a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a romantic level a a a romantic level au au au au on a romantic level a romantic level au on a romantic level au a romantic level a
we can get in both both pockets and now that we establish the show and how in the engine show i think we will undertake to know
helps not just saw the crime but helps him deal with life it is his
responded to this relationship ah the way they laid they loved to me that the show was very complex the writers the writers
on steps of the season i watched it four times i was in again and stood a wild zisk
attention and they seemed to be reacting well to and of for us not talking out of them but were never writing to her of our smart
we had wheeled as well as an episode that was ever about religion nevertheless and we had a great compass
ah well paris which is what i was torn out is it very setting up so but at length we couldn't shoot in paris all these
the matter what happens in paris and a and it's sir but because
we'll be at the week with robert downing and now we've stayed we've stayed in touch and and for many
he's a funny guide to his that's gets everything he wants er until until this happens and that all sorts of fall hard so when er when benson's day were first meet him
i love i'm in my forties and i think old guys then in their mid forties are trying to keep
music and what's going on it with the culture and with tegnology and this is a guide that that's doing it he's he's in there is dating young women he's made his fortune with the latest cunning edge tegnology i'm none of those things but it was a nice stretch for
clearly very welcomeing i i can't i can't give another set that i'd rather beyond at this point i hope i i hope i i hope
i shall like this any of the lawn orders sometimes the guests get the grays to do because they go solve the crimes we get to commit them so
bald of them these two characters in particular had the most from what i have seen
berska and crisis characters we've met the other people on their lives we've seen their pain and so we get so we've an episode words more about the guests are as we still know the their back stories and it has to get helps to make them
i think what makes television shows last a long time is his chemistry i mean that the scrips can be great if if you're not really gibing it can only the love can only go so far i think people really dig there is a risk altogether as a real model anything that the nature of these stories
just there solving the crime the crime gets us and got every time because it is it is about victims it is about women mobbles always and there we all have sisters and mothers always and their we all have sisters and mothers
that the casting is everything comraderies is everything you can have great writing it that never gets realized if if there isn't a jail
theo cassim process was amazing because to make a characteristic annual palatable you've got to understand what others can see in him and she's such an apathetic character in such a beautiful girl that
and she and i have just connected and that can be that can be taught you on connect with your with your lady lady when your softened crimes they belong to as but she's so great and the bringing scout wolf on to show our j smith of our burden is a so lovely lovely lovely group of evilers in the bad egg and i think that
have something that i realize i may never have and
in the last five episodes a definite shift on daniel's part to how he looks at her
there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change your life i don't affect you at all it doesn't change your life i don't affect you at all all it doesn't change your life there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change your life there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change yours nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change it there is nothing to be afraid of it is nothing to be afraid of it i don't change in life there is nothing to be afraid of it does nothing to be afraid of it is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change it doesn't change it doesn't change your life there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change your life there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change nothing to be afraid of it does not change it is nothing to be afraid of
feeling inside that you made a lot thousands and thousands of people in their family's happy by simply checking a different body
serve well i have to carry away to the gate community on a sick calm and
didn't think it would be her it's like there's something that is a bigger subject matter that we can ah
for god's sake and then stopped drinking so much beer as i honestwise thought

and he loves it that's the thing he know he is he's a teacher and he's a scientist and he loves conall wheeleding a m that that intelligence around and of course the irony being that because he's scheherenic his his brain can turn on him at any
in me which is great and when we shot the pilot which was six o'clock a years ago now has gone back to two thousand ten but i did a lot o research i want to make sure that i i got it right right out of the gate er because it matters because i wanted the er the metal health community to respect the shell would upbraid
trust my instincts at who the sky is and we can have just the lot of a lot of fun solving crimes coming up with really interesting twists and turns that only a narrow science bent and and his expertes can er can
my favourite is the shell begins and ends most most episodes with with lectures
way back to you won't let me remember this of the paper chase in the seventies which i just loved
shell law school show a and and in this the lip of the lectures are fond he's like the professor you wish you had he's like that guy
what he does and funny and all saxony i hope and a huxto and these kind of book end the show and and a gibbeta a different feel and a nuts a m it's exhausting but it's a it's so reward
there's sisters always to morrow are you can never take it for granted that this is good alas forever as an actor even even even in an unsuccessful show they can come and go and am you've got to keep inventing yourself and and keep looking forward and remember that this could all disappear and first of formers comes from your family and to
he hadn't ah because he was a general practitioner he was a doctor
could it be an actor it was looked down upon i think he just kept his secret he hid behind his doctor and this but secretly stepped down
very wooden and shallow as an actor so i found that it just lent
that would be over help us what they should take away i think is this sense that that there was a time when when
fear might have been the moderation behind them ultimately was about entertainment and about
counterproductive that way we we jumped ahead in the in series finally two twenty years later so we've already seen renegress separating come back together as older friends so i
you know i think if we whatever union it will be as actors looking back
on a tuesday night in front of an audience where the shell lived and the audience was set at waited six months for these tickets and and a room was absolutely alive that's i think that's where to show
of people living with turnips and sophronia are our high functioning i can behold a job somewhat as very responsible jobs i am there's a woman who's been a real influence to mean him to ellen sax who is a law professor at u s c in in california m has been lived with bernards at sophronia for years she wrote a book called the centre kennel
yet at nobody may actually have held her out a job and may actually have had something else going on that do not we can't just dismiss them the stigma of metal illnesses is the biggest thing
like daniel with such influence and at such ability reminds me
well it took for me canada days also my son's birthday he was born in the states as american born but on canada day so we're usually up there my wife and son are up there at now in canada and her husband and cooper ah with the fireworks and the barber cue you know very much the same as says here but i existed because i mean i mean i'm still a new yorker finishing up a shown
we we were doing a very very funny bit written by willing grace writers and will and grace as sent to deben i were doing our characters and we had a very funny bit about about how you know that the treble project is it is about
a m gain straight our equal that that they hopefully were getting into a world where it's not an issue that kiss won't be bullied and we we made a joke about not only the equal how they're better wouldn't it be great of our kids to anybody had a whole bunch of jokes about the things that are
completely shut down that his whatever comfort he has in the class room he does not have on a crime scene he does not have in the f b eye offices with the clattering typewriters in this and the phones ringing its
coaster and in the midst of it he's a guide that is hence the title to show he is perceiving the world in such a way that it makes him an interesting ah the
i is is the guy that keeps a daniel pearce
centered because strangles a guide that should be on his meds and he is not a m and that is a oat a key element of the show without max as his
he's it would appear to be his teacher's aid and his servant a a a assistant but do he's a lot more than that he's
keeps daniel granted enter does my wife do the same yes in fact i with probably the opposite i probably drive my wife
oh i it's horrid it sets almost sounds easy to say from some one that is sir had a chance too to achieve these things but i just

you could make up a question and he would give your real answer he was bizarre he and no and he's also an actor so he understands us he knows how to talk to us and knows how to motive
everything across the boards everything above title is all slights alone you realize he might be a genius and it's no views in a abuse word but he might be a genius the guides

eja effected in my first play at four and a half and i played a
stutter in ramascoina how you had gone round a run around the room near by reach of a small small small smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller smaller
i should speak but in another but if i didn't like a star stir
and i was in a louder pressure and that's also that's also part of the stutter
likely while another's also when now some parents who live
like a you said you sawed the edgy as d'ye see a sigh yes i guess now i know that was a real wackle that was a crazy guy and he chopped people up and he was strange and odd now the stuff and i was very good in it part i love this kind of characters but everybody thinks you must be
made me round for forty five years fifty years and a
iced okay so it isn't about your quality it's about how much how much how much i want you've done so i've been after a living i went after everything and i'd buy since since then i've probably made under
that if he never insulted a child who had a child physically river ever humiliated child that the
he's a nicest person i ever met and the best kiss driver
questions fans asked me are things light do you know she's to get along and i and we do and a you know lemmy leming leming clear something up right here right now all those rumors about us us now
all happened because i got her started and showed missus wright so then she gets pretty woman and becomes the the biggest stronger or more pretty woman and becomes the the biggest stronger
and their press was told in a targeter like eric's little sister and what one day she got sick of it and said i don't want to hear his name any more so said oo it must be a following thing no
every day and i go to him life and ever i can because he makes my
a wonderful series called bullock in the face asked he one of the
bullet in face it's cool anyway it's an eddy is ard and i who's my favourite comic on the planet because i've heard because your proprietor died and dying at er and er i love the guy and that he's a great guide to and we had a good time together and we made and we made a series and that we made a
the other getting up a series and i think it's can be good it's a very black black black black black comedy and a eddy is art is worth a price for
be so gifted he's so smart and he's so gentle to night's coming
er better yeah where we're having a good time of sentence also everybody's very sweet to shear i and i i know it's i know it's who whether because it's always done to one of being prepared for a time and it buys cranky because i've on all beautiful clothes like i mentioned and everybody's very sweet to sheer it's very nice but it's to excuse me new furs
a very a very small what i consider to be
lovelace at these whole lovelace about linda lovelace with that
she as she grabbed it and held it held the holds on to it well she said she's really it's bigtacular one
i think i think if this if this film gets so beyond the distribution that obviously will ah
here promotes a lovely cinder and double it in the face and a and say high to you and a my and my family big fanciers by the way they are the love watching you and now just that it passed from i told
for pie and is called pie bakshaw
beg shop d'artagnan p i not p a e but p eyes and pie and a fewwhat the best plans
only ah it is a major problem and is dealt with in a way that that there would have to do
i were i would lie about it but ah i think i think this state oddly enough has a very good glove
way far away and i was tired and i get home and i'm told by my wife i've a manager that i i have an addition for a circle of heroes and i went i'm too tired can it
after story i could not get a day for three years with a nice girl and that's not
whereas it is supposed to be and that you don't know where he can take our people since i recruit the heroes is he looking for and
or the week after in my brain that i should change the whole course of my
anybody in the city's students no matter what contrasts it had been a sheer enemy it because i am rather happy in riding her noosing directing whatever it is she's everybody you make like you been a bigger boss to morrow
the butcher was originality and the cleverness of the script i mean it was something i had read before or seen before even though it is it is a sheet of mud bang on neck and down move
anything else in the whole world it's what you make of it and i know that sounds
i i think i don't think i do eat it but i understand them in our being in my forties i understand their mistakes i don't condon them but i understand them and go and not anger with either of them any more i think i think
a most men stable but an they're both a rhirant's table but an they're both a aren't a rhinocero and stable but an they're both a most men stable but an there're most men stable but an they're most men stable but an they're both a most men stable but an they're both a most men stable but an stable but an they're both a most men stable but an stable but an stable but an they're both a most men stable but a most men stable but
which is a big problem but a point but a book besides it to grant
what had i get out of it i basically i basely ruined every relationship i ever had ruined my career ruined everything so i had nowhere to go but a
which ah it is a good thing because in the words of thomas jefferson we needed a revolution every three or forty years
eighteen seventy seven all the heaviest up and then i kept i kept shipping and kept kept revisiting it up into really really living and kept kept revisiting it up into really really really a d seven all the heavy stuff and then i kept in eighty seven all the heaviest up and then i kept up and then i kept in eighty seven all the heavy stuff and all the heavy stuff and then i kept up and then i kept in eighty seven all the heavy stuff and then i kept and then all the heavy stuff and then i kept in the heavy stuff and then i kept in the heavy stuff and then i kept in the heavy stuff and then i kept and then i kept and then i kept up and then i kept up and then i kept and then i kept and then i kept and then i kept and then i kept

thirty years or some it's a big deal of volcano so they fast
it's an odd question i assigned anything i never thought about but
my family and how but but i'm but i don't want to
on the show so everybody who like watches us understands all the colors as supposed to just
friendly things and a myer my wife and of these things you know pay

like me i have i bad things about me but but the sky was
and i so was hard to play but i had a great director about bossy so i was lot of fun and rare powder work the only thing
wrong with it is after i played that role in society i couldn't get a day of the nice growth of three years
direct tribe ever really loved and i probably really loved but half a dozen of em
and ah but she's married to it in a fore a real reason you're not just because she wrote it no she she has real reasons and if you listen to her she probably is a most intelligent woman i've ever been a room with with with the exception of my wife
that's a huge cartlet kazar in my wife's a bonify genius anyway i'll yeah

keep you can take advantage of a second chance and if not you can create the second chance by re inventing yourself which i've had to do in this business and show business and i
pis capantivi because i want to be an actor and then it appears an act on tivy now real life on a real cut who acts once in a while so i went complete circle i took a vantage of the opportunities that presented themselves
alas why i can personally identify with the message of second chance
i brought that that's there it's always in there somewhere no so i brought that
the joy of being involved in a distant project one of the really great things about the movie is that you can bring your child your compartment from the screen and you can let him watch this and it that child will walk away when
the with the know how and the ability to understand that there are second chances in life that it once presented
but he races and of these quite good at it he's champion admired and
that he has a misfortune of his engine
and what happens is that they can't produce that part they don't make it any more it's continued it comes that time in the movie where he has to he has to go into this bridge and then he's got a power up to go straight up
and he meets those challenges but at the same time puts himself in jeopardy like fire fighters do every day front line because if he goes to a certain level of speed he could blow up he could burst
he's achieved a second chance and any also shows great brave brave chance and any also shows great brave brave brave brave brave brave brave chance and an he also shows great brave brave brave brave brave braves his second chance and an he also shows a chief's a second chance and an he's a chief's a chief's a second chance and an any also shows a chief's a second chance and second chance and second chance and an any also shows a second chance and an any also shows a shows a second chance and second chances a second chance and an any also shows a second chances a second chance is a second chance is a second chances a second chance to second chance and an any also show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show show shows great braves a
people that become copse people are to get involved in public service where there are light
because they stepped to the left of the step to the right or they walk in on a situation like police officers one of the most dangerous things as
a officer and its dell to italian the most dangerous call is a domestic
these people this is their job they become this because they compassionate
the john thus changed it as after the third day on the beat for me and i worked graveyard because i couldn't work dinner day i brought up on a house or an call
inferred fire fighters who are the first to arrive at a situation at an act
then at first to show up that they considered we call him his officers we call them the front line we were right there with them but bed front
thank you isn't port this movie says thank you fire fighters thank you for risking
they don't really care about getting them out a little really you don't really care about being
they will at the audiences or like of the same reason i liked it ours dwell personally i am glad to have been involved but the movie itself is exciting its funny it's really funny ed and the music is
a simple thing that you get a child at five years ago you could teach a child if i was
because it's proven they're more retainable at a young age so that's why you got again a child young give him the necessary tools to go on in life like

arizon for four seasons we did a hundred forty eight of them in four seasons time we questioned those babies to
here and we should er we shoot one a week and then it was a lot of fun i did the way i the way i everybody took to me or as if from under guidance or the

can place himself in the position of saying that's me i could do that i know how to do it because your imagination
and remembrance remembrance is an awful big thing
and nothing else you take the printed word and you make it come from your heart in your head period aye i said that one time to these youngsters that were in yale university grunted the yale school of drama i was invited to let you the people at school
ah well are you one of those damned i what went dorry they used to call mullin brando a what that school of acting
i said what we're doing right now just talking between each other we're acting this is what actings all about we are acting twithers you're listening to me and i'm listening to you and i answer you in kind so i'm back and forth that's
no i don't know none i believe couldn't believe it i said what else would
very soon shoot the answer by going right you're right that's what acting is all about because it comes from here
over these things you know and i i love a loved reader between the lines you know to me
my personage but i have the personage of this character that the the writer wrote about
and so i i go over each and every line do i understand
does that line make sense to me oh why would i say that line if i'd enough i wanted to say something else what would i say in its stiff and if i wanted to say something else what would i say in its stiff in its sticks to me does that line make sense to me does that line make sense to me does that line make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i say that line make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i make sense to me oh why would i say that line make sense to me oh why would i say that line make sense to me oh why
and in all these things i taken to consideration as we're going along reading and studying because i was feeling somewhere out there as
you see what do you say what you say you've lost them you've lost them because we say you've lost them you've lost them because we can't you say you see when you say what do you say what do you say you see what do you say what do you say what do you say you say you say you see what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say you say what do you say what do you say you say you say you say you say you say you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you say what do you
sense to you yet you had to say it because and i say
that's no good so you break down the word you'd look up and something that pertains to that word and you asked the writer about it naturally oh yes yes i should have thought of that myself but you know you work it out and then the first thing in all those thumbs are satisfied as it could tell you that was a good play that was a good play that was a good play that was a good show because he believed it
not the words of the yao are of this of the of the play but he believed what you were
and i are still bodies still friends we now work to leave it a knot as voices sponge father a play bird made
and and as we met at that date at dinner at the first time we did it we looked to each other what have we

look at the script a mighty said no not at all so he read this script and a couple of weeks later at a party
it is goes around killing people that's all he does and it's bitches and i'd stabs him to death and do that now i said don't kin yourself he said this kind could do

from china oh after working on a film and was kind of frustrated with his career
while you know i've first done get the addition for congo or the meeting for congo i
asked having a really racing wholly creative work in and very some courageous
the hard time doing but it was right to be a part of it and that about the point you were first and we didn't get the aculates within getty he made nominations and with a recognition from the industry but i think by the time we finished and the finals came along
here you know i just because i was the warden of the prison so always felt that i had to
about them and so became very poor for me to pull my old in the midst of all that he also meant
and put my suit on and shod my shoes which become my
character and when i set out i am said the friendships of those i call the warden glad
ah had i got a simple kind of capital disunctional name was a invited by the lunch but somehow wasn't invited to know as always

in the movie never reason to be there first they come up but yet not i may allow love the checks up out of some one that was something made and the you know i don't believe in supporting you know so you'll be there abe in the audience eat my pot corn
ah before he became a movie no smells better enough
i'm and i'm you know the black panther is probably a
he considers what he is i'd like to pray him to be a part of it but i don't understand some glance of glances of glance of glance of glance of glance of glance at what i'm very happy to be a part of it i don't understand it what he is i'd like to say it what he is i don't know i't know i't know i't think i'm very happy heavenly to be a part of it part of it part of it but he said he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is what he is i don's what he is i don's what he is i's what he is i's what he is i'll he is i'll he is i's i's i's i'll he is i
i don't always understand so we know just where you can't know that if i'm not to stop
eh you know it over the ears of it over thirty years and all these little girls and a ghost lost down fancy come up and that
he's representing in old and dumb you know the script is amazingly funny that
you know so i'm back and will marry and that act roy is the only weaver and we all coming but the girls
who you believe is the best performance the worse thing to happen would be for someone the boat based on
or the performance i'm so stout really i think you responsiblely the academy as much as the industry to be more inclusive to allow people of
nonsense excuse i'm we need be more encloser why
that is the director's and it is all of us excepting the fact that it is all of us excepting the fact that doctors and it is all of us excepting the fact that our directors and it is all of us excepting the directors and is all of us excepting the directors and is all of us excepting the directors and is all of us excepting the directors and is the directors and it is all of us excepting the directors and is all of us excepting the directors and it is all of us excepting the directors and it is all of us excepting the directors and it is all of us except all of us except all of us except excepting the directors and is all of us excepting the directors and it is all of us except and is the directors and it is all of us except all of us except and is all of us except the directors and is all of us
the world the way the world is i can't say how many things have seen as i know
so we just have to be and i don't think it's an attempt i think it's just a lack of awareness he'll go out and think about that well as time
then really focussing with the problems because i don't think itself i don't think it's a major problem which has have to be
moved with every saw whenever so they tied the monkey into their lives and the heritsmen
even never saw or little in talk about so as i said accuse that you
yes i've been quite blessed i think it's a you know i'm an actor and so my job is fair
well i'll be a really lovely man after she's bill and he's always been not here
stronger moving a second one was more family friendly yet i think of your little kid and poor parents who wanted to give
a lot of lines that at the time i was saying them i don't realize he would be holding him out three
i don't like your work and so akemonia beat his eyes
for people as you see the movie ends and he and his registers in our soul we've got a god and and he and his registers in our souls and they've got got got a god and he and his registers in our souls and they've got to see the movie ends and and he and he and his registers if he'll be blessed to see the movie and see the movie ends and and and in his registers the movie ends and in his register and the movie ends and the movie ends and in his register
seen the movie about a hundred and fifty times and he knows every line in the mow
this had a name that ghost was his three because we never thought we'd come over another movie and then m bill murray decided to do the biddyo game and of an instant
point which he realizes that the past has gone and she has to move on in a part of that movement
here for thirty years a people of putting on the jump suits and making the bagpacks and turning the cars in actamo bill
you know the world can be difficult but i i'd just sent very amazingly bless
so are you mad i don't know what that has to do you know the hardest thing i think is trying to
time to do something and you're the and i'm very good i can really discipline myself in it and i'll trim down and drop
three or four nights in a row you know it's gone out i'll side it really ah because i had responsibilities
ill association franchise what is going to now we have
nonsense not that important may i love you parted but you know because the studio has made choices that somehow left once and out of it
and yet i don't just as soon as possible yet when we may go out of those classes i know they're going to call me i don't know any

and she could see me and a tavy monitor and her studio and it was the one session when we got a chance to do scenes together and it was really quite amazing for a number of reasons one is just watching her work and your seeing the
the greatest time watching finding dorry i think a lot will first
it's dorry and it's marline and there they're back you know in a big way and
in our the same i think you know the same sense of adventure that ugh that the story kind of a told in finding a nemo
is pretty much there in spades in finding dorry in our ah there are some amazing adventures funny and terrifying and
get along with my my daughter from my first marriage but the daughter from my first marriage
yes my second wife and the same with my mother who played
up in this sponsi situation that leads to the whole witness protection
a thing but if you knows it as a e as a dad i don't think i'm a disciplinarian
that's one of the problems with this family that stems for me i'm just not strong enough for a should be and i'm not not not not for me i'm just not strong enough for a should be and i'm not not not not i'm just one of the problems with this family that's family that's one of the problems one of the problems with this problems with this family with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's one of the problems with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this familys with this familys with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that's with this family that
medea in that in that sense of you know discipline and modusen doubts you know i had some eccentric and in deuce and doubts you know i had some eccentric and
they was fun hanging around them much the ways fun hanging around me did we didn't get the same sense of distance
definitely was a fan of finding me i thought it was one of the great animated features
just as it was funny it was hard warming i thought the voice that ellen brought to the character was quite amazing and
a what brought me to dorry ah they asked me to do it and i said yes before i could even hear the rest of the question i had said yes before i could even hear the rest of the question of the question of what brought me to dorry ah they asked me to do it a what brought me to dorry ah they asked me to do it and i what brought me to dorry ah they asked me to do it and i what brought me to do it a story ah they asked me to do it and i what brought me to do it and i he asked me to do it and i he asked me to do it and i he asked me to do it and i he asked me to do it and i asked me to do it and i asked me to do it and i asked me to do it and i he asked me to do it and i he asked me to do
the boot it was the finding nemo seek

i was fascinated by what they did with the face
because the character of the animated character doesn't look any fortune in him the animated character doesn't look any fortune in him the animated character doesn't look any fortune in him because because the character the animated character because the character the animated character because the character the animated character because the character the character the animated character does the character the character the animated character the animated character does the character the character the animated character doesn't
its own distinctive kind of character i didn't recognize my
and kind of in my career and that then i thought was really quite amazing

one the inn of what seedy see over which as they couldn't argue against the fact that this is a person's name we have a right to you know to use that as the title it's the name of the family that founded the
first successful comedy show said tom not comedy shows say come that this country of
the audience without its being the real name certainly not an impression joe was not doing an impression of lloyd
as there are no boundaries you can you can kind of go where you want to go creatively and if the audience wants to go with you they
the most appropriate name for our shower shows about a wealthy wealthy family who lose every ever every shower shows about a wealthy wealthy family who loses every every every everyday
ah so they lost and ate they bought a town when they had my money losin they'd they'd bought a town when they had my mud money when they had my head my head my head my head
senior old son as a birthday present and in the reason we bought it as a joke was because the town was called chitz creek and now that they've lost everything the only the only place they can actually afford to
show him a daughter sairs also on the show planks while the waitress and dan my son
well it's a different way to go i mean an improvised movie like these movies where we can't have a written outline and but we don't write the dialogue ah is it is a very very fun way to shoot a movie because you just don't know what's going to happen in front of the camera we don't have any rehearsals are so it's far so it's far it's far it's far it's far it's far it's far it's
to to improvise and you always use kind of improbization in
second city show shall we we was like mid seventies when we saw our first chicago show and there was there was we noticed a big differ
scenes ah i wasn't i i a year out of a and i thought while how could they do a scene this long kind of with very few laughs and yet the
ah the light the late grade gilded runner and and the so we did see

if if this work's a for the studio and they're quite happy with it i mean i wouldn't be shocked if they decided to go for another one but you see now something tells me
you know i mean if i was a bedding man i guess i i might say this could be
well i it's not it's not that it's not really that difficult but i understand why why it's still shocking to people because that's thea the personality of the movie i think you know they if you can't be shocked by an american prima

nor can't putting into sleep now i just do you know i just say i excuse me can i get a rupture for one second could you get
put in front of him but by the you know honestly when but when when the when the camera starts rolling a he may get to two or three of the scripted questions in the rest he just goes with it it is
is the one of the great creations of all time and its amazing how fast and how
i can a kind of get the same give and take you may not necessarily get what you're expecting from the people that're working with and i've had some
pretty scary like in a finger nails on a chalk board
scary kind of experiences where where ah you're just not a lot but but a couple that that you just wouldn't want to go through twelve but a couple that that you just wouldn't want to go through twelve
but but you know mostly mostly have been very i really have been very lucky i've worked with people at our great that are smart that are funny that you know they're always working at the top of

physical attributes to be a tom hank's kind of leading mating may make rebukes to be a tom hank's kind of leading meeting made in maine at rebukes to be a tom hank's kind of leading meeting physical at rebukes to be a tom hank's kind of physical at rebukes to be a tom hank's kind of physical at rebukes to be a tom hanks
of this to night and and delighted to have been a part of splash the movie
we set out to make a dan and i my son down we set out to make a show that we
ability and we we conned did that and our sensibility really is
as a fly in the wall and all the sudden the money is gone yes so that was
the you know our we have great writers and danced doing a great job running in the room now
in this town now which means more interaction with the towns people and i think that's what all the characters in their own ones want ones people and i think that's what all the characters in their own ones want one went on in this town now which means more interaction with the towns people in this town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more in this town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the town now which means more interaction with the towns
well it was ah it was a pretty exciting thing when we
as and ah and it was the inn when windy's when i finally got to hear what the story was how the characters were got a moving along and what what did john and hayden the writer directors had in mind
for this sir i got very excited you know when i because i thought there there's story the way they were lying at i was very excited
and kind of fresh so it was a it was lot of fun

oh it was fit it was fantastically one of the great things was knowing i was going to be doing scenes with gentlemen with stiflers ma'am and getting jim's dad stiffly his mind together was just i thought of just an amazingly brilliantly brilliant together was just i thought of just a amazingly brilliantly brilliantly brilliantly broken and one of the great things i thought it was fit it was fit it was fit it was fit it was fantastic it was fantastic it was fantastic it was fantastic it was fantastic it was fantastic
and end and in a week we had a yard and went our
and numb and it was just kind of fun on the sadden it was so for the
thought it was just a really interesting way to go and stepping outside of what
brilliant aspects of the script was making jim's dat a widower because it did open up a lot of different now avenues here and one was that it's kind
enabled jim and his dad the kind of you know have those
so that was ain't i thought that was the that was pretty amazing and you know quite on
a scene i shot and in this movie was in back in the bedroom with jane
like i was doing the original american pie everything was the same the wall paper the dead's
you know that everything in that room was a it was identical to the way it was back then so i i was a it was cut of a spooky experience
it certain doesn't happen a lot in one's the career enough for to hit on something to be associated with some
very well because i didn't get to work with them at all i generally get to know they're then to work with them at all i generally get to know they're then to work with them at all i didn't really get to know they'd get to work with them at all very well because i didn't get to work with them at all at all very well because i didn't get to work with them at all at all at all at all

street with her arm around my wife she had her shoes in her hand walking down the sidewalk
squeeze in a stage piece in i'm really strapped for writing
ah and a lot of times they just didn't work as well because they're stage pieces and of course we when we performed them we performed them at the same energy level we thought we would on stage because that's what we were used to doing they didn't work as well but the newspiece was a great television a adaptation because it was it was it was it we were doing on stage and when we just put it in the show it
lineit tang edith prickly started as a stage a character a
i don't remember but i but i am your clarifying this form in which is great so then the show went
it was a nice place whatever i don't know what the point is but what is i enjoyed my house i don't know whether they
i can tell you what it was when a pool with a lovely chance was whizzing in the guest house i don't think you really care about that
i only did the shows when not when andrew called me to say do you want to come up and do and it guess none some shows but beforehand i had no intention of going back i just thought it was sympathetic
thing but i did go up and guessed for couple weeks and that when i got up there i i saw how the production had been had just
it was amazing we'd never had production like this in trial it was the inn of great direction great light in great sets seeming it really looked dazzling once i got up there and said woe
we would check off you and afar you are here now this was that we were working our asses off on the
with him was so much energy and enthusiasm that you know at this point round about there our second last season you know we were we were kind to getting tired and it was marty's energy
and an unjust positive vive in attitude that kind of picked everybody up and now we had the kind of come back up
asked yes well i was nineteen eighty one during a hack under jeanne de mannion ah
of the io just when the original cast had laughed right nineteen seventy nine or something like that and the new caste came in new producer i did hear that that they wanted to put us in the saturday night eleven thirty time slut
oh i think because they are opposite in some senses because he's someone who's always worried he's always just this brain is always in conflict and that comes across when you read the books in sort of it's almost tiring because he never stops thinking about he's really goes with the floe he has to it like her mind he tells me as a saving person he does and he does and he does and whereas when i's when i's when i's been really goes when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's when i's
she can do to her stuff and the events therefore she just enjoys them and and she i think she helps harry come down and realize he can
in as dad as in phileason it's just so much for i've been partly love good plan i think i'm i'm being learning you sometimes feel like your the outsider it's just something and that goes with her and but when it was with her doubt i felt really relaxed
different it's not like any of the ones before because they're not a haggarts any more an the sense that am it's it's the seventh book so i've done this was the big question when the book him at would hurry liver die and that's the thing in the film you
it there's no double door the weasels are gone there's no one to protect them and you've half done set there these tea natures out in the world and the
and haggard i can't really get my old pictures in the head and what the ones who are friends was that they were they in the book they they're not their character
i think he's a little bit self conscious you know oh and everyone's against him in the fifth book and he doesn't want
by her and she she's wise she is really good and silent to people
cos she doesn't have any friends and then when she hurts she likes harry you know ellen
during this army which she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to him make friends you know she likes she's not alone or although she
kind of the bad i do not know one likes me i'm the very like
yes i learned from her that by by having that by not worrying you she said yourself a little troubled
they don't do anything their trying to protect us from them failing what they actually
she's she's too much at one with herself that she isn't need to so and and people just root it always asking the cab as if it would be the
almost a little bit i was a little but first sight blue that's a bit you know i don't but i i think i can come in back here for when i'm like those before i came back when i came back here two days ago and and saw and met the people who were running in it i'm just i'm really happy now but it's only happy that it's
it's like leaves in its night at the home of harry pye which is such a nice thing and we've also have seen some of the people coming through
and their reactions are just amazing and so rewarding and it's almost
yes truly and walking through the great hall especially there's our umbrella scenes i did with but friends and em like
i love those scenes wherever one came back as most of my scenes were either like just what dan or with the
of the d a member is six of them and but these once always every one
oh of the creature shop and i think my favour in the creature shop
phoenix m he's really really beautiful and m ye are he just like a slave beautiful and m ye are he just like a slave's little and he just like and he's really a beautiful and and the phoenix and he's ready for the beautiful and amyx and he's ready to read a beautiful and am he's and he's and he's ready to read a beautiful and he's
he so cool and m i just think they've taken all his personality and his his interests into account when they've built that
like the sins allah alikes and race car games
were entranced by the pharisean and the world that she could only create a
no not ill we have had to see world that when we don't experience it i think
it's interesting it's like an escape but it's nothing we're related to and she's great
french and every place where i just think at the moment it's a ready good time too
the whole film was just towards this battle was freely big and
that the special facts were pretty well with us and and three d i was i was fit them sceptical about the three d effects but it worked pretty well and and yet and yet and yet the three d effects book it worked pretty well and and yet and yet and yet the special facts were pretty well with us and that the special facts were pretty well with us and and the special facts were pretty well with the special facts were pretty well with us and and and and and at the special facts that the special facts were pretty well with the special effects were pretty well with this and and and and and and and and and and and at the special facts that the special facts were pretty well with the special effects were pretty well with the special effects were pretty well with this and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and at the special effects and and and and and at the special fact
you'll just see every every character kind of get there and get a moment in it and it's surprising cause it there is so much to pack in but m all the teacupers have been to there to write this seriously they'll come into their own own own own own every every every character kind of thing to their right you'll get you'll just see you'll just see every every every every character kind of get your kind of get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll just see every every every every every every every every every every every every every ill to get your kind of get your kind of get your kind of get you'll get your kind of get your kind of get there and get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll get you'll
she's could be wherever she's meant to be m an an' an she doesn't that that's what you never see you're worried she's always just quite relaxed and even the battle scenes she'll never start sobbing hysterically for she's always very so for
only be positive and and it's the right way of thinking like worry gets doesn't get anyone anywhere
i'm like i think i think she's a very spiritual character that m she's she at else the way she sees herself whereas
and they don't have all this self died herself i'm sure i think that some people in our
because they believe you know they're part of nature and they're perfect for that reason that's so ilunna is that's why she's always so calm and trusting and so i think fate is a big part i think hermione i don't take her on't take her only and they're perfect for that reason because they believe you because they believe you don't believe you know their part of nature and they believe you know their part of nature and they're part of nature and they're perfect for that're perfect for that reason that're perfect for that reason that're perfect for that're perfect for that reason that reason that reason that reason that reason that reason that's the perfect for that reason that's the perfect for that's the perfect for that's the perfect for that's the perfect for that's so i believe in that's
when there's no evidence purely because there's no evidence to the contrary she just likes to keep no one mind was for minny everything i speak like
of it all his the whole purpose of his life is so
all his the whole purpose of his life is so deeply ridden in his past and its
such a long stretch of time m and i think yet just the maiden as anne has harry says he was the bravest man he knew he gave up his whole life
likes when i would put on her clothes hers was really colorful and and bright and sole unlike what any one else could wear
sings and and it's it's it's lovely such a relief to do not because i'se was i with generally very more than her own and when
you're being talked about and you're worrying what people say and and but when i'm playing luna i don't have the
i suppose i will get you with me he's older better enough to use a box and well than if i had them i
so i am yet i remember my boy when the meeting with him were fair and very clearly the first time it was at my screen to ask so any one got the part then so side from being just there by just like the carlisles when there was a bet actual addition
oh he i am just like it with that day with such a flirt and my never coming in the cabin got my custom on and wages
i did i had two butter veers we were at we were on state or during them a life leaking while
yes it takes even worse you know because i've had this now just for the films of edison's eight so i really don't even really know what kind of person i was before i had harry pott
and cause might last up on the harrywater tour there's the premier it's really fine but you don't see love your friends it's a bit huge and and just let's be don't know where it
and annie it was lovely because it's like i happened for being quite down about this going out like some to after the first
experience we're going yet and going through and that you can talk to some one that's the say i was saying
to the lineha i design that m but i do not i hope that people take for
she really likes it cause cause she doesn't have any friends and then when she hurts she likes her
with during this army which she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to make friends you know she likes she's not alone or although she's alone she's alone she
cora all the loftiest shown to me and to all the members of the harry boncass and an m you think you're passing
it's made that's the more it appeared heading the part here like actually going from the little world to the visiting world and that's why people everyone was certain once did
went to act in if i had made for this so ready put an end to this and confined megelva and ovahdovna had made for this so ready put an end to this and confined megelva and ovah and ignaty and if i had made for this so ready put an end to put an end to this and went to all went to act in to acting if i had made for that i had made for this so ready for this so ready for this so ready to put an end of it to put an end of it so ready put an end of it to put an end of it so ready put an end of it to listening to all went to all went to all went to all went to all went to acty to acty to acty and i went to acty and if i went to acty and if i had made for that i had made for the bad food if i had made for the
a little of it like inside out but it was more just the child in me from heaven plain and i didn't know how to approach it it carried through i was already like a
really had a connection with and so doubtless just the kind of i kind of i did something that was
small scale because i wanted to stay slower and i find it
charming they was ah because it wasn't i don't see because it was just
but your skill frederick's is that you have to be so much more responsible like you but wear yourself give to look at yourselves because they don't have the luxury of time to
he'd go it over things and and sometimes it it can't come out like an awful word as a harp
like great so yet there was a certain i felt more i had more grade of freedom i suppose
listen to the audio books the performances by jim dale of the american editions of the books countless times i mean we're talking about numbers in the
ursules almost as some one who's been in the desert for so long and perceval graves who is a smart man perceives this and is exploiting it by saying hey you in the desert here is water
but graves also need something from credence there's a ta
that seems to be the dynamic of this mutual reliance that then starts to crumble as they both start to realize or to think that the other one does not have what they
a incredibly fun we had it a really really wonderful time flashing it out in rehearsal and realizing it on the day we really we would be very exportive m david would give us a lot of angles to play with the scene from
very attentive probably like every single person who worked on his film very attentive to try and to on
the subtleties of the dynamic as it was written because that's the amazing thing about a heroling's work is
and they had the bull horn and they were yelling mean things at people
uncle image david yates is the antithesis of that image he is the opposite of all of those qualities
incredibly quiet he maintains an incredibly quiet set the focus on the work is really strong he's very sweet and kind and warm loving and supportive but at the same time he is a director who will challenge you and will accept nothing less than the best and most authentic performance that you're capable of that
and i'd accept the note and then he'd walk away and i'd go he is second how did he know what i was
in a sense when we really love a story we all step into
i don't know for me a lot of my material in this film is just conversations between two people a a lot of the other actors has a lot more to sort of fill in the blanks of in their mind but i will say that what i did do
work with the visual fixed apartment was really co operative and they were always trying to let us know what things would look like and they were watching our performances also to inform how they were going to make these images
because remember on the playground hand two people'll disagree about what you imagine in you i no no
sort of had a moment of temporary insanity and jubilee on the street
i wanted to do it as seeing this like mac raking aspiring investigative radical journalist who was obsessed with unrest
and so a theology of putting himself as this over dramatized character that enochin
in this power is corrupting him and what was supposed to be a movement is becoming
amen because i think people are naturally duets because i think people are naturally duets
in a level there isn't a wareness in a baby a baby when even when a child is born that's a nine month progressed organism with a
removed from kind of what makes us human were becoming less and less under
act can can be forgiven i mean because because we weaken all on some level under state
these are incredibly delicate and complex
ah that's that birdie was yes that bertie was honest with you i don't know how that bird got all that information
i i yet am a humane butterfly this was i still
nineteen twenty six new york some long underware because i really like old school long underware they're so stylish you've been just aware them as pants you look
clay credence bear bone and he sort of a sad character he's grown in spare bone and he's sort of a sad character he's grown he's grown in spare bone and he's sort of a credence bear bone and he's sort of a clay credence bear bone and he's sort of a sad character he credence bear bone and he's sort of a sad character he's bare bone and he's sort of a sad character he's a sad of a sad of a sad character he's bare bone and spare bone and spare bone and spare bone and is sort of a sad character he's bare bone and is sort of a sad character he's bare bone and he's bare bone and he's bare bone of a sad character he's bare bone and he's a sad character he's a sad character he's a sad character he's a sad character
city part of the enchantment so i can fit anything in there but that it is extremely
ah the people in history who who might have actually had some magical
get now to control sort of falling out of line and how that's how that how evolution happens ona
often having brother miserable lives and being rejected by society and
in some cases triumphing and managing to enjoy but always outside of
but it's almost like credence got miscreants got left behind we're merry wi man
what they could have been if they were never subjected to that drama is tragic and then thinking about
it's somewhat like a valve remember in bandclass at school where they did the gross wood winds that he would have a spit vow here remember they'd have to allow the spit
drift off and start playing with a prop rehearse staring
the body all art is made by the body if we're a singer we're dancing with our vocal cords if we're
and for me what i guess what i was interested in or what i'm becoming more and more interested in is like a lot of times in acting we talk about setting intentions or what is your character's motivation in this scene which is great and is important i'm but for me what i'm becoming more interested in is instead of intention paying attention to the body and paying attention to the body and becoming attention to the body
i can recognize are we need you to run we have this enormous treadmill i think it's called a
needs visual effects and what were trying to implement is a wide diversity of tactics of how
i don't know how exciting that bye if it would really be because you'll make me growing up and see sir burthen you jersey and like getting some roland we like how with this boss
think we live in the coolest craziest city in the world and the most lively vibrant city in the world
the city is so amazing and there's so much going on
yet it has all the energy and all the vibrance of new york but may be time
i certainly had that period i remember when i was about thirteen years old
everybody had an identity everybody had these opinions
and so i started to have my own opinions and i served two sort of carve out my own i did it
you know i had to pretend like i hated the music my parents like even though before then and now again now i can admit it's such
good looks can only get you so far and did often people don't care
girls with artistic sensibility and humane art and i tend
love or relate to some one else if you can't first love and relate
actors trust to their instincts and working with
that there is nothing more important you can intellectualize and think about a character or a
the best thing you can do is let your internal aware now
and to listen and to pay attention to the other actors because there's a danger in thinking too much
that you will ignore what's really happening and you'll miss
i say at all the time i say it went on alone you know just that is bee like not
i could i got the niagara gold like a fanatical the outward would listen into the body but almost every day of my life for
even like a serial ball this is like a a ball you put them sort of sauce or garnish in very shall
connectedly that his dozen young men was talking about it because i'm obsessed with
an addition that involved doing an improvisation was just a couple
conspiracy a deviates a david hayman they came to new york and we met
a miss vit certain by design in those ways i had a breathwine studder when i went i went i went i went i went i went i went i when i went by design and i was raised i had a breathwine studder when i went by design and i was raised i had a miss vit sort of by design in my design in those ways i had a miss vispit certain by design and i had a miss vit sort of by design and i known ways i had a miss vit certain by design and i had always i had a missed in others i had a missed in others i had a missed and i had a missed in others i had a missed and i had a missed in others i had a missed in others i had a missed in my design and i had a boys i had a missed and i had a missed
out of the opera i was beginning to have questions about my sexuality and was started at questions about my sexuality and was started out of the opera i was beginning out of the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have the opera i was beginning to have questions i was beginning to have questions about i was beginning to have questions about i was beginning to have questions about i was beginning to have questions about the opera i was beginning to have questions about the opera i was beginning to have questions about i

to that sort of invention or creativeity a m an in fact makes people feel really stifled and like they have to be outside of society in order to express
a root of the problems in our world and i can be can see the correlation pretty
most prominently surfaces and bears its teeth that's always him to be tied into the misogy and if we don't address necessity that
it all intersects only he's intersect with the oppression of women
because i had a speech of pediment and that almost threw me off
i have remained if at least partially immersed in that world my
m even in my most rebellious adolescent times i would still rich
hear anything i was i wanted to when i heard about this move these existence i just wanted to be in it whatever way could i never dream there was going to be a roll that would be my agent would be so complex
so then when i had done in an english addition and went and talked to the venerable conspiracy of david's that is hameon and
saturn because it was just so intriguing and exciting and sounded like this really beautiful metaphor for something that i knew in a certain way on
but when it comes time to work there is a focus and an intensity there's just a raw power honestly that
that he has and he channels i'm that sir wendia when the scene would start and he would become graves with such a complete transformation energetically you could feel
you know form a unjust very friendly bond with him a
new credences is drawn to graves and doesn't really see the he feels the sinister but doesn't really connect with it or identify
er contexts either that are some of my oh the conference of my favourite works and some of my favorite
evil and berry is just getting into it and seems exciting and very
remember when i told my data was eight and i'm going to be a performer artist
and in being initially undertaken aback but then having a really quickly coming to the conclusion allowed that that is
and harmable my dad said that to me like feeling like sort of i go a ma
what yet i was right there though i was on the cuss and here do one i was
i think that makes us less whole i had as as people
resakelling these these weekly drawing these battle lines m
human beings are amazing and loves and is an honour and an opportunity
different songs but i would when i was a kid i would only let him sing one song as the song used to fall asleep to
very interesting again very challenging but very entreating exploration
so amazing really to play a character whose in i've played dark sad upset disturbed and characters of other varieties before
but this was six months of shooting you know it is very different
in terms of the the execution of it for more than a couple months enters vact
returning to credence's body i brought up challenges for me that i didn't expect i'm in terms of
working on this film and she was very generous with me she became in many ways i'm my
fairy godmother in england even as she was playing my bad foster mother in new york ah
he had just an unbelievable opportunity to work
i'm an incredible channel into many art forms i'm yet think what's amazing about sam is that she's every medium she's music and she's phillipson is that she's every medium she's music and she's phil's film incredible channel into many artfulm an incredible channel incredible channel in to many art forms im incredible channel incredible channel incritical channel incredible channel into many art forms im any credible channel intical channel into many art forms immmmmmm any credible channel incr
she do know creates film and she's constantly writing and she's constantly creating and when she's she and so when she comes to a the project it
she just brings all of these all these incredible resources and she had some experiences in her life that were almost parallel to credence's experience and so she was very excited to play this role because she was almost able to bring a bray excited to play this role because she was almost able to bring to bring all of these all these incredible resources to brings all of these all these all these incredible resources
and i feel only comfortable saying similarly that is because she's spoken of it said
and so she is that she had this deep understanding of these dynamics that she was actually able to share with me and which she was actually very helpful for me in the formation of my
it's so cool i'm yet so cool honestly this year's been so thin
but inevitably fall into i'm it's been fantastic here i'm but going from fantastic beasts
they are to this very different space i mean in every way the tone
the character the physicality it's almost
it's more than you ever really even allow yourself to dream
good to be true i can't really describe the feelings it's like butterflies but there
a daily confront the reality of abuse
than to victimize that other instead of dealing with ourselves
easy to serve not pay attention to the fact that that's happening in so many of the homes across
but it's real in it something that we have to deal with so yeah lot of my
called childline in the yuca who are there a response and outreach programme for
hurt their organizations like that that exists all round the world where you can find i'm support networks for people who are survivors of abuse m and i'm really grateful childline let me so to talk to some of their responders and then also talk to a talk in their organizations and then also talk in her organizations like organizations like talk to some of their responders and with their responders and then also totost all so talk tot that organizations ir the organizations i's like that the organizations i's like that the designs i got that the day
some survivors also talking to some people in my life or survivors in it a similar way like a really similar way to credence that specifically in foster carrion the tram of
of losing or never having your ear biological family i am but then the process of going from family to family and sometimes these people come at foster care the wrong intentions so all that was the hardest part dealing with that confronting that because i i just found that
probable in our world and it's on microcosms in homes and in its the macrocosm
a er that we create just apparent to child parent to child care
yet hobbled lying definitely i was i was getting a man
eh i mean that's that's true remy it shouldn't be that this was this our form actory if you think about what it is in a basic form which shouldn't be a beauty content
you're great yes that's what i need of arguing shot at in a remote country in snet a b s pnacks
i was like who in their right mind would take stephen cheloski's
but when i was born i can't really remember it is one
boys kids kids play and when kins play they make believe and they put themselves into this
to stop playing make believe and i'm i was really lucky to find when i was like sick
i gone to opera and then was able to actually find really like an krook
chorus or they would sing with them at for two years or then it was like it tog about being sanctioned to as like professional none
don't want a work just for the sake of working i want a wait for the project to be right
something that will er will challenge me in and in something that i know i can bring a lot to
see the final result in it so in like moving in emotion
in any sweat when you know i feel so proud of this film every time that happens i feel i become like it reinforcements my will to be
the the that whoever had who whatever the brain one
either there or other it was only so far you could go wrong with what we done out
i certainly did not expect how far right it had gone
i mean i was crying when the film ended done and i
and there was this young girl who would
this film was made for one kid in nebraska yes and we're trying desperately to find
love to be able to do like the ingogio and ruducto spell
just to make things different sizes so i'd like to write now be able to make you very
i would have just clung to the wrong pearlman's head a and played an ear a if that's what i had to do to be involved in fantasticism or to find them so if that's what i had to do to be involved in fantasticism or to find them so if i'm the roman's head i would have just clung to that wrong to that wrong pearlman's head a would have just clung to that wrong to the wrong pearl man's head a and
the fact that the character was a dreameral for any actor was just a very very luscious icing on it already
was really fantastic when you see nineteen twenties underware ah
you understand that they had the new things back
i i don't identify with that i think that makes us less whole
human beings are amazing and loves and is an honour and an opportunity and a fragile thing a
now i mean i i guess i mean i'm some one else dowd
you know drink from that well i'm and drawing information and get
oh but i would certainly pre order them on line at the first available opportunity a and would wait for them eagerly like go and check the mail box long before it was possible that they would be there that sort of thing or the katy wake
here and yet would listen to the audience almost every day of my life for several years embarrassingly
in one way or another specially when we are children we have such an access point of magic through our
brought back to the true magic that we all partake of i reminded again
of oh and again and again it's that it's friendship you know and that
a imagination of what magic could be but then ultimately were always brought back to the true magic
i think that is a truth that can be found through a lot of the wisdom traditions of the world those a people who do practice magic own i think would agree with jacob
there's a something at the root which has to do with how human beings have this dangerous tendency to separate ourselves from the world and the beings around us
with separation of we lose awareness and with a loss of awareness we become frightened because and when we're frightened we often a lash out or demonise or target what were frightened of and
you know permeating all culture is this dangerous element of seeing some one else as completely separate from yourself losing awareness of how those people are different but at the root always the same and then demonising and targeting other people
the dangers in the world that jacob rolling seems to time and time again direct our attention to and what a great time for this film to come out as
situation is unbelievably dire and we've had we lost half the bow
no matter what no matter how quickly we can pull it together or
our inner ship on this destructive path were
