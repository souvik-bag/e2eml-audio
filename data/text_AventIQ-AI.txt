 I just happen to have, you know, a tongue that says some things at certain times that people wouldn't expect it.
 my kids and for anything in the world. So the show deals with me being a father and having that many women.
 Because all of my baby mamas are very cool young ladies. You know, basically we just sat down and had a conversation and said, look, we adults, the kids didn't ask to be here. It's not about us arguing to bring up old issues that we might have or still have. You know, we got to be adults and do the right thing, buddy.

 It suffered back in, I think it was the 70s or the 80s and they wanted the boycott because they didn't like this country. Meanwhile, people have been training for 10 years.
 He can't go because somebody got an attitude in the White House and the Capitol.
 hell alone and we all know then is a wrap to tight but the boy was trying to articulate a situation on some news station and they tried to corner him into asking the head of the Korean people to pull somebody out of jail to send jail over there
 and he looked like he'd been partying all night, wrongdo the as-to-do politics. He played basketball. I don't want the boy negotiating for me.
 that you want to negotiate with you on any kind of deal. So to ask that man, that question is retarded of the question asked them.
 I hope you make some money. And for the brothers that went with you, have some fun.
 They're going to play ball. So let them play ball. That's what I said.
 Take your ass over there. Obama, you play balls. You did that with your first garden.

 every motherfuckin' phone is a tracking device.
 as they know what the fuck I'm at right now. You got one in your purse. They know what the fuck you at. You know what's that mean? Now a plane has a black box in the motherfucker. It gives off some kind of tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. Don't nobody know what the fuck the dweep coming from.

When I was at stand-up workshop learning to do stand-up, because I only did sketches, he was down, there were different types of stand-ups you could be, you could choose one, and one was the sort of god-like genius era, and that was the Robin Williams. You can head to that, but only if you're crazy, you head
 he could have done it more, because I think, oh, Amazon America, if you get successful in comedy, you will go into a television series or a film series, and that becomes key, and it's a different thing to stand up. So I feel he did occasional stand up tours after taking off into such a huge way, but not all the time. He was so wonderful at it. I don't actually know why he didn't come back to it
 That was, that was just Robin. He was a nice guy, but I first made him on a film.

 They, in Paris, they can go, oh, yeah, squirrels, EQI, they can fuzze, or they can banjo. You know, they can go, oh, yeah, that's stupid. In fact, in France, they don't have much absurdist humor as they go, or surreal humor. They, and I said, but you know, they, the cool people, they multiply them.
 cooler people, the people with a certain amount of education, they can dig surreal humor. And it's just the references. So my theory is there is no French sense of humor. There is no German sense of humor.

 So if some language is really hard, there should be people saying, okay, here in Russia, these kids just don't speak it, they just point at things.
 That time, I think it's... Now, I could be wrong when I get to Russia, because I haven't actually laid in. I've learnt the alphabet. I've learnt the alphabet. And Dylan Moran has, too. And both me and Dylan Moran want to do Russia in Russia. But I've got to go to Germany next year. I'm already touring France in French. German next year, in German in Berlin, two months there. Then I could do Spain for Spanish, and then Russian, and then I'll be able to report back more accurately. But I think it's the Cyrillic alphabet that makes us go, whoa!

 So I thought I should go up and help there and so I just got myself there and then started trying to help work with activists there and
 Mae'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd
 I think it's beautiful that Britain can do that. You can go from them coming in from escaping from the Nazis to their sons.
 No, no, I was going around, as someone who was going to politics in eight years, I was going
 focus you know it's a five-year parliament it could well be so all the focus keeps going towards the sitting government so he doesn't get so much action in front of cameras this is the
 I know Nathan quite well and I haven't seen everything he's done so it's just great. I just happen to be in town for Comic Con at the weekend and this was here so I said well yes I'll come it's great so you know great cars Nathan Lane
 in the film studios, but I do, when I'm doing theatre, I love doing it, but filming is my first
 They were and oh my gosh, they are my company. I think I think I've stolen everything from
 Indian golfers have a 30-second memory, so they don't know how long they live. They never have fear, they don't have worries. They can't remember their worries.
 Everything is going bizarre. I just, I don't think anyone in Britain could believe that someone could hack a phone of someone who was, you know,
 We'll be going, why wasn't I hacked? But no, I'm quite happy not to be hacked, unless I was hacked, and then I'm not happy to be hacked. Yeah.
 show and there's one or two tickets left if you want to just be sitting in the nice place because I think at the back the people are reluctant
 just doing it. I'm doing it on my own so no orchestra the orchestra has been told just just hang around guys and there's all these guys with violins
 the gig tomorrow. You'll find as you walk up and and buy things and stuff. There's going to be a lot of violence. It's just kicking the heels around.
 It says it's just us nine and we have a big table and but so they came down we'd say what but
 That's what goes on there, but I'm very positive on Europe. It's what humanity does. We gradually come together. We gradually get fairer rules for everyone.

 years, 300 years, whatever we're supposed to have in the UK. And so, you know, countries can go backwards.
 It's not that all Canadian mayors. I just thought, when I was in Montreal, they were saying, you heard about the man, right? Yeah, I got here and said, you heard about the man.
 which is about three hours worth. And then I actually ejaculate, but not in a sexual way.
 So, if you are of an ethnic minority, you can actually rail against January the
 people with money. All these kind of things, if you're working class against the upper classes, but if you're straight and white and male middle classes, it's just useless. So thank God I'm a transversive.
 to journalists back in Britain that I was a transvestite and now I don't wear dress and then people I have to
 people to believe me that I am a transverse or which is really weak. I never thought when I first came out that I'd have to
 or pants as they say in America, they don't call that drag. So I say it's not drag for me. I'm stressing a feminine side of myself. So I'm just wearing a dress. I would wear makeup and whatever. I'm in boy mode at the moment, just like the human torch. You can do flame on, flame off. So I'm boy on at the moment.
 I remember some friends they had this amazing Lego we used to wake up anyway, so that's a seven that I was a morning person after that it was now is all down

 because it was Ted Marathons and my feet had started to heal and I was running
 I tried to do 27 mountains for Nelson Mandela last year. I'll go back and repeat that next.
 And yeah of thing and when they're gonna work it out they're gonna say that's the transvestite thing and certain people have got it and I'll go Yeah, that's me. I got it and that's how it's gonna work
 And my thought on this is that if they were fighting back in the 6th of June, if English speakers, Americans, Canadians, British people, French,
 coming up. So yes, I'm doing an Al Franken, Senator Al Franken, I'm going to be following
 What do you do? I'm a student, I'm from Kathmandu. Really? I said we speak good English. I said do other people speak good English in Kathmandu. Can I play there?
 things in life that, you know, I tried to do my things, but I never actually sat and worked out which parts of other people I would

 Well, I'd come out six years before. So I'd actually come out in 85 and it was clear I was taking off in 91. So I told friends and then I sort of
 Transvest that was in a bad word. What a negative word. So I was TV. I am TV. People said you're television. It was TV and T.S. Transsexual TV.
 and then trans, and so I said, okay, I'm trans, yeah, and then so I said, either you're trans, but
 You know, boy was wearing a dress and I had it at this and I thought, and all the other kids thought it was funny, but I thought, now that sounds like I'd like to wear a dress. I didn't know why. I couldn't wear that and I still like girls. So I am a straight transgender, wannabe lesbian.
 Yeah, I'd say boy quality. I never had that. I never get drunk in the butt. I never could get the drink.
 But very focus, very, one of the special forces is one of the two paratroopers,

 And I give off non-victim vibes. I give off non-victim vibes. That's quite 30 years worth of.
 I don't know what I'm looking at. Maybe not Nazis with knives that, whatever.
 I will stand my ground. They say when you're riding a bicycle, claim the road and it's better for you to.

 you know, just living that life be cool, everyone's got to like write to be everywhere, you know.
 the other performer, I was working on the stand-up.
 He's known for being a covenant television, and they were, eh, yes, he knew him. That was interesting. Actually, I'm going to go back and say, yes, he's going, what's going on there?
 good comedian, you know, friend of mine. So you're cool with me, then you've got to be cool with him. And then, so then it was taking sides. And so they said, so he said, are we all cool now? And they said,
 sort of and says okay we'll do a selfie and then the boys were not cool and all the boys
 open air format because there's so many other things that people can do. In a theatre, people are watching
 script, someone's going to time it, and that was the beginning of me developing my voice and for my own character.
 Because I always played characters with voices like this. Well, small idiots who said, I don't know, I don't really want to be there. So I was playing these voices like Monty Python, and then I started developing my voice.
 that took me into stand up. That's the front part of my stand up. All the back part is me doing sketches. I set up a scene with myself.
 Mae'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith. Mae'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith
 And then I couldn't get dramatic roles going. And I made someone laugh when I was 12 in a...
 And then I discovered Python and the Goons and Martin, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, and I thought, OK, I will not do drama, because I became a spotty teenager. Most teenagers go into this spotty acne.
 God, if there is a God, says no, you'll have the worst looks that ever happen. And so I thought, I can't do, I can't be a hero, romantic hero. And with this going on in greasy hair and pimpley
 Never see her again, and then you go to a boarding school and you don't see dad for two thirds of the year, so it was very
 difficult to survive, I just closed down emotionally, really. Stop crying. When I got to about 11, I realized crying was bad, because you lose arguments that way, so I stopped.
 And so they decided, well, keep doing the job, kids will go
 That's an option. So he used to go to sleep with the radio on just to have voices happening in the house.
 Since then, which is not standard practice. Otherwise, everyone from boarding schools would go and do all this stuff. I'm not sure. I've got a determination, genetic, I think, going on. I've got a bloody mind in this thing. I can take quite a lot of grief coming my way and push back on it. I came out 30 years ago being transgender.

 was hugely tricky, because I told everyone in 85 that I was TV, transgender, whatever, trans now, I think we're called. And then I told my dad six years later, it was just don't tell dad thing, and I thought, now I've got to tell dad, and he was cool about it. And then I told him on a Saturday, and on a Monday, I did this first
 I made one joke about being transvestite and then I thought I got to turn up in the dress and that was a few months later and I thought my career
 get off the ground or longer if you go back into the teenage years. And I just thought this could kill it right here.
 True, it's right. It's what humanity needs to do. We need to feel the fear and do it anyway. You need to push back against the extremists and the hateful people.
 trying to stamp on you, who have murdered transgender people and lesbian people and gay people for thousands of years since the dawn of time. You've got to push back against these disgusting people and say that we are not disgusting because they've been saying we're disgusting. Actually, this is genetics. They'll find the code at some point and I'm just a human being. I have certain rights just to exist and the guilt and shame I'm not having that.
 and they said well that's in its infancy still because there's so many millions and millions of pieces that they still haven't quite got

 I still have got all that side to me, but there's also the girly side and I've just been honest and told people
 Well, like, if I look for it, I could find it anywhere, anytime, probably, yeah. There was a young woman in Brisbane who said, are you wearing lipstick? I said, yeah, and said, you're sick. And then she walked off. And then my makeup artist, who happened to have been, due to the champion of Europe at 15, she went off after her.
 Before, over 30 years since I came out, for about 25 years, yes. My confidence has changed recently. I'm running for Mayor London in 2020, so I better be ready for whatever.
 Yes, but I also, you know, I wanted to do all the things I've done. If I had a kid and you're trying to drag him around the world or you leave him in a boarding school or what do you do, that gets quite confusing and it's also my relationships that are difficult.
 I started taking off without... I'd already told my friends I was transversed up, but I hadn't told the police.

 The last one was in government. The next one would probably be in government.
 but what I'd say now is that in the 60s and 70s people paid money to buy heart and soul from the Beatles, the Stones, all those bands.
 No, I'm not in the line to be James Bond.
 You know, I actually want to do action movies, but they won't let me so I run 43 marathons, and I'll do my own
 I've done Treasure Island and the director said, you know, because I have basic Treasure Island long john silver has to go around on one leg with a crutch. And it was a very 17, 1700s type of crutch. They basic crutch had to go around on in sand. But I had the stamina to do it, because I could run all these mountains. But it's just that I think we're all designed.
 When I did two in two days, I did think actually I could stop now and I could dine out forever.
 it was surreal and no one would believe me. I was running all around the UK from capital of England, the capital of Wales, the capital of Northern Ireland, the capital of Scotland Bay. And people just wouldn't believe that
 If you go in shops, you won't see that one up front because they think that's too risky.
 But they swung with it, you know, that cool.
 a visual sense of humor in Britain, except a visual sense of humor. The Germans have no sense of humor, and they say all of America has no sense of irony.
 I rather died, actually, because I did a play. I played a raven. My mum made the raven costume before she died, like she died when I was six. And I remember not being that bothered about this sort of performing thing.
 then I went to a boarding school and didn't see my dad a lot of the time and then audiences were like a surrogate affection machine. So I think that's when this lust for the love of an audience came.
 or you know, hour and a half, two hours. It's quite surreal. I watch a lot of telly. I don't read a lot of books, but I said no, a lot of facts, which I sort of weave in between. I do a lot of stuff on history-based things and I talk about the Romans.
 but he had stuff where Moses and Jesus came back and then the back of the St. Pat's Cathedral, you know, and stuff like that. But it isn't heavily used, and I suddenly thought, I should go in there because I love this subject anyway, because I think the future's written
 and watching the swept up. And for four years and then I got to stand up, realizing I had to lengthen down a bit, became the buzzy comedy of Britain.
 I started talking about it, but not wearing any makeup or anything.
 sometimes not. And then they said, all right, he is a transversible, he looks a mess, looks like a small

 and it's gone further down the line. And there should be gay bisexual and lesbian transvestists.
 Because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny and the bottom line of acting is to be
 And I don't think it's going to, I was wondering, is it going to go away? Is it a fad that's coming down and it's going to go away?

 good stuff at school, 17 and made a lot of people laugh and as about 17, 18, I did something that was quite dramatic but that couldn't help me at that time.
 Next I've scared of flying so I let the fly and I found that to put the plane back down on the ground you need a confidence bordering arrogance to say this piece of
 singing to myself in a cold, rubbergy day. But I was quite confident at this point, putting out the T-codes with these animal T-codes.

 All in a part, over this season, a lot of relationships have been tested. The show has been getting bigger and bigger.

 And it's been amazing. I really lucked out. You know, I was psyched to get on a TV show and then I wound up on a really fun one.
 We're already a kind of thing because I remember when we're doing like oh they're doing another team movie because I think scream had come out and I think can hardly wait and
 And so we're like, oh, this is great. We're doing a movie. But then it became
 If it was a funny script, I mean, I didn't think they were gonna do a fourth one. When they did the fourth one, I heard about it. I was in an audition and someone said to me, hey man, they're making another American pie. And I was like, no, they're not.
 I can't play soccer at all, but the weirdest thing is, like, anyone can put anything on Wikipedia.
 going into the show and was like oh my god the show is so great everyone was really excited about it you know it's a really unique blend of comedy and action and procedural and
 you know, serialized romance stories. And we were excited that we had something special. But just like you said, there's so much
 I kind of had been in the earlier in my career. I played a lot of the best friends.
 the goofy neighbor, you know, so I was playing a lot of characters were kind of along the same lines as Joey from Friends and I was trying to make a transition into more leading man character type roles and so I was going through a
 of a dry spell in my career and I hadn't worked for
 It took a little while for me to convince the business that I could play something other than what I had been playing. So when I walked into the test at warehouse 13,
 I needed a job. I wanted a job. I just had my second baby, my second son had just been born like two weeks before that. I was staring the reality of not having a job or any money squarely in the face.
 There's two of each character when we walked in there was like seven or eight seven or eight Micah's and seven or eight pieces
 He just kind of go, oh, they have no idea what they want. We're just a number here and my chance of getting this job
 Micah's in the peets and going back and forth and going back and forth.
 It seemed to me that you could kind of tell, at least I could tell, who they were paying attention to. And then the guy that went in right before me, the director came out.
 Come here and he put his he put his arm around this guy and he walked down the hall with this guy and I was like
 with the regurgitated worm and give up the worm and I got no worm.
 Worm to give and I was actually saying that out loud

 The show every week is kind of a mini movie. It's not too serialized, so if you miss an episode, you won't get completely lost.
 And for me what's great about the show is I have a couple of

 and the adults can both watch at the same time and both find something that interests them and something that they can relate to. It reminds me of the old days when they used to have the Walt Disney on Sunday night, the Disney movies on

 We don't take ourselves too seriously, but at the same time, there's some great drama. It's our exec producer calls it a thriller omity.
 And that's why I think people should wash it, because I think everybody can relate to it.
 The artifacts in the warehouse are really just plot devices to get us to what the really show is that it's

 five or six ojuras with no with bunless chaps on. So anytime you can see in ojura with bunless chaps, I say that's a good time right there.
 But if there had been some, I would have had
 You know, we kind of always roll our eyes at what's your favorite artifact or what's your favorite episode.
 No, I don't mind. My favorite artifact is Abraham Lincoln's hat, because Pete put it on and had an irresistible urge to free Mrs. Frederick.
 I thought that was a really just a good episode for the show. If you remember, it's part of the two-part finale from season three where we
 It made me feel a lot of pride for the show.
 I mean, the reason I like the show is that it has
 you know, it has action, it has horror, it has
 It has, I mean, it's all, it's all the genres kind of wrapped up into one.
 The kids can watch it too. It doesn't talk down to kids, but still the adults can watch it.
 You know, Pete's been sober for 13 years. I've also, I'm also sober 13 years. That's a, that's a good one. I love comic books.
 I was never a Marine. I was never a Marine, but I have a great deal of respect for anybody who

 You know, he's he's one of the funniest. I mean, he's one of the funniest smartest guys on the planet that I've ever met. So I think the success of the show is
 because of him and because of sci-fi's willingness to let him do what he wants to do on the show.
 And I'm actually kind of in production with George A. Romero. We just finished a script that we're trying to get made for a new dead movie called Road to the Dead.
 It's basically about, humans have now exploited zombies because that's what we do as humans.
 We exploit everything and we've taken the zombies and we've used them for our own entertainment. We've taught them to drive in kind of a death race where we watch them re-die.

 It's H.G. Wells is on the show this year and we find out that H.G. Wells is actually a woman.
 It was believed or H.G. Wells believed that people were more likely to believe that a man had written those stories than a woman. So she used a man's face, her brothers as her and wrote as H.G. Wells.

 One of them being that everybody can watch the show, it's not just

 No, the question that then comes up is people say, are you going to do a second trilogy?
 I think we Joe really well actually and and actually you know this script was the first time we've written together for quite a few years I think sort of
 And just trying to think, I guess I was probably that sort of five years since we were in Hot Fathers. When we had the story idea on the Hot Fathers press tour in like 2007,
 It was. It was at Sydney Airport. It was when we were landing from Wellington to Sydney. And I still had the idea on the plane. And I was thinking about the script that I'd written when I was 21 about teenagers on a pub crawl, which I'd never done anything with. And I didn't necessarily want to make that film now. But I thought, well, maybe there's something in them being adults and
 You know, there's richer potential in the themes that me and Simon keep coming back to about Perpetual Adolescent and what if like there's one guy that really wants to do this pub crawl again and the other four aren't that fast?
 you know, forcibly regresses them or hell breaks loose. So I've mentioned that idea to Simon and then we immediately kind of like sort of started hashing out the story.
 But then when we came to write it, like years later, it was good. We both had a break. We'd both done a lot of other projects. And it just came out very fluidly, because we'd had a lot of time to think about it.
 in the memory, like it didn't need any more hangovers and stuff. But I, yeah, I done one when I was 19, which is where the original script came from, which was a disaster. And then in my late 20s or mid 20s, maybe after space and before Sean, me and Simon and Nick ended up in my hometown and we tried to do it again and that went even worse.
 So I think sort of then then it started to really strike me that this was like a
 pathetic sort of like attempt to recapture teenage glue
 came from really and then the sort of the idea of the blue kind of ink inside is because when I was a kid
 Reminding me of schools. I wanted to make the actors all feel that they were back at school again by covering their hands with it
 I didn't even tell Empower and London Laya sort of but here's the thing is I get very superstitious about like sort of talking about things before they're done because I
 to be the boy who cried wolf and you know talk about something if it doesn't you know I mean it will happen yeah but it's I feel very jinxy talking
 addressing you know based on the fact that the character is like grown up through this kind of pop culture and that he is like living his life
 big daydream. I still see the film is like a big daydream is it. Scott Pilgrim is like a
 character who's in this kind of you know sort of perpetual adolescence and hasn't really grown up yet and he's living his life through the media that he consumes and what the film is about at the end of the century is about him kind of growing up
 So I won't go into that too much because it's also something I haven't worked on that for two years. I have worked on this film solidly for two years, so the last time I actually did anything work on Ant-Man
 Eight weeks before I started in Scott Pilgrim, and I wasn't around during the shoot with Tull, which was an enormous bummer. Because I basically worked on a film with Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson, and then I wasn't actually around to be on the set at all.
 the boat, like to actually watch that all in action. But in the case of that one, I didn't try and graph my own personality and we just tried to be true to her day.
 you have to watch anything before the new one I would hope all three movies are standalone
 Brian Forbes, the Stepford Wives, and very Brian Forbes in 1975.
 I like to think that me and Simon and Nick would work together again.
 It was six years to talk to us and we really
 sort of moved everything else away so that we can make this one and before it is too late.
 He does these incredible vocal warmups just before a take, which is something to win this.
 I actually, there's quite a few zombie things I have not seen.

 is amazing and Brian's ending is great and I don't think they really
 We knew it was going to be something slightly different, and Brian actually was involved in writing the final scene, we actually.
 involved in it and he was very happy with the idea that he would diverge.
 I think because Scott Pilgrim, like touched on a number of genres, like action comedy, romance, fantasy
 Like action it was always gonna be a slightly harder sell and I think you know like
 I think it wasn't because it wasn't completely generic, like sometimes people would just want like
 I have no idea what that is. So I think it's just down to sort of if you're trying to do something slightly different, you just gotta work twice as hard.
 and it was a tough film to kind of like so it's playing so I think that's the
 But on the flip side of it like I was very proud of the movie
 winner ever and but we all were very proud of this show
 and we just had sort of faith in it and then it eventually found its audience on DVD. So I sort of went through the same thing on Scott Pilgrim. I just had faith in what I'd made and then it would get out there and I feel that
 Films that are massive, massive hits kind of like do their couple of months at the cinema and then never get seen on the big screen ever again.
 see them ever again. And what's really nice is that Scott Pilgrim, like somewhere in the world, is playing like a
 you know like the Prince Charles show all the time and like the new Beverly and Los Angeles and I like that I think that that makes me very happy that people are still seeing it with a crowd you know and also that it's
 Now, I think I already got all of that out of my system in the Scott program. I feel that, and this might be controversial to say, and maybe Duncan Jones with World of Warcraft has demands to beat it, but there has never been a good video game film. And I think so far, and the reason for that is, is it's just like
 standing you in the face is that a video game is like a sort of a unique experience to you you are playing the game and just like watching somebody are
 My answer is there is no game that I would like to adapt. Maybe rampage.

 Chris Nolan's Batman is very different to Tim Burns's Batman, which is very different to Adam West's Batman, and there's room for all three.
 No, I don't really read too much other stuff to get sent my way.
 But for some reason, I read this one, and I could see straight away why they'd given it to me. And actually, I think I read the first book, Concubine Hothel, hadn't come out yet, actually. Think about that.
 He was just off to show the dead and and just reading it if anything actually reminded me a bit of space

 Yeah, I know, but I definitely was that kid at school. When I was at school, I was comprehensive. I was short-sighted. I didn't know I was short-sighted until I was 20. And as such, I would frequently look at the window in classes, because I couldn't see the blackboard properly.

 Yes and no, it was a pretty organic process. I mean, we had a structure worked out as far back as 2005.
 new material as it kind of came together. Brian, when we first started, we had three books and
 and then it kept developing, right up till shooting. So even the sixth book we knew how it was going to end and then we even decided
 i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith i'n gwaith
 Like what we did, like the world's end is a real pub name in fact there is like several in the UK. There's one in particular that me and Simon use
 I'll see you at the world's end. I'll meet you at the world's end.
 to illustrate what was happening in each one. So we wanted them to feel like tarot cards. It's like the name of the pug tells you
 It's like film is a visual medium, so if you're looking at the ground, you may as well be at the theatre.
 is literally represent kind of like that lots of identity is like this sort of like a
 I think with this, it was definitely like so, because it was the culmination of Sean and Hot Fires, which were all genre films.
 You know what, my script didn't feature that at all, so it wasn't a problem for me.
 you would want the audience to see it as the journalism which is cold so why would you want to spoil it for
 I think it's just it's pretty obvious is that you want people to see it live
 Like sort of juvenile antics. So it was a sort of a film about about regression and about the perils of like nostalgia and like how it's dangerous to go backwards and like how you can never go home again So we thought like you know, we both mean Simon are from like small towns and came to London So whenever we go back, it's always a strange and sometimes bittersweet experience and we thought that was a great kind of like template for a sci-fi parent
 Absolutely. No, I would never rule anything out. It's definitely... I don't know why people would think it was a good buy to the UK. In fact, you know, I had a blast making this film and it was...
 because I haven't really started on it, so I don't have a lot to discuss.
 and even to the point where there's the big, kind of sonic face-off between two bands.
 is in the summer of 2008, I asked Nigel Goddrich to get involved in the film.
 It's the first score he's ever done, but prior to that, way before, like, 18 months before, we started to get the artists together to portray the different bands.
 Hollywood song in the film, why doesn't Dan do that? And so he did the Patel number Cornelius, who I'm a huge fan of.
 Here's sex bomb playing was designed in the title seems to be a lot shorter the title was was was really short and then we actually expanded the title seems
 the opening song changed. One of the songs was going to be on the end credits. Nigel sort of said, oh, you can't say that song on the end credits. Surely that should be the one.
 you're shooting and thinking this has great you know really should so it went far away from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the song
 it it feels in that respect you know does start to feel like like a more like a 70s film like fans would
 In the case of this one, it was something where the genre, like a lot of sci-fi movies, the genre came out of a manifestation of the fear in a way. And the movie is about people returning to that hometown and realizing that time has marched on without them. And Simon's character is a man who's 40, who wants to be 18 again, so the kind of the actual
 The aliens in the movie essentially represent the kind of that fear of change and that loss of identity So this sort of the things came together. It's actually like I literally like When I was like in my mid 20s when I saw we used to go back to my hometown every like kind of like holidays like
 I would like sort of get increasingly kind of like sort of bemused by the fact like, oh, like nobody remembers me, like none of the bartenders remember me. The school bully doesn't remember me. It's not so much that I never left, it's like I was never here. And I remember saying to a friend of mine, like way back, I said, every time I go back to my hometown, it feels like invasion of the body.
 down. So like little ideas like that like stick is like okay you can never go home again you feel 80
 a bigger reason and in the movie like sort of like so all of these things that came together it's like we wanted to do a movie about kind of like
 The dangers of nostalgia and like a man trying to turn back the clock and you know, but then even just the thing of like a homecoming is that sort of like
 effect of it is as much a coping strategy for me and Simon is for Gary King. There is a scene in the movie where he finds out that something is a foot and he is happy when he is talking
 He's can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like this
 He's not as big a legend as he thinks he is and that the town wasn't all it was cracked up to be anyway So I think in this particular case it was something like this is the story which is like sort of like the sci-fi is a manifestation
 something's a foot and he's happy when he's talking about him and the reason he's happy is he's
 He's can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like this
 He's not as big a legend as he thinks he is and that the town wasn't all it was cracked up to be anyway So I think in this particular case it was something like this is the
 Because it's like a satire and stuff we draw a very sharp line in the sand at the end
 with the drunk humans, you only have one choice. There is no middle ground, but what the movie is about is the
 You know like that our hero like Simon's character is extremely flawed and is like makes a lot of bad decisions and does some terrible things You know like and he's very questionable like in his motives a lot of the time and yet when it comes down to it is that what makes this human is like the fact that we are flawed and make mistakes the key is can you learn from your mistakes? So that we wanted to make something which like sort of like You know, it has this kind of like big sort of philosophical sci-fi climax, but with drunk people
 plans other than that we'd like to work together and like I think the thing is like sort of like and we're very proud that we did this third movie and as much as fans want us to do another one we wanted to do another one you know but the the other thing is that the sort of that maybe fans don't know is how hard it is to get these movies made so like you know if you want us to do in that film
 specific criteria for these movies is that they're all like genre films that are really like Trojan horses for relationship movies.
 they're all about like perpetual adolescence, loss of identity, the individual versus the collective. They're all about growing up.
 theme so I think that means if we did another film together we might do something
 This is all three of the movie's health fast shorn and this one they all have endings that like
 going for a sci-fi film. I like the film, Saul Bass's film, Phase 4, which is about
 and it's really spooky, it's kind of like a mix
 super macro lenses. So it's a really spooky film. Good performance is really great photography. I watched it on TV when I was a little kid and then later finally come back
 Spanish director who only did one other film which is also a lesser
 but it's about a couple that go to a Spanish island where kids have taken over. The kids don't say anything and it's kind of like, it's like the birds with little kids and it's particularly like grim and spooky
 It was also known in the 70s as Island of the Damned and both films by that director.
 There's really worth watching. It's by the same team that did
 charity event in this village which then gets taken over by terrorists. So then the Olympic
 is so much fun. Born to fight. I highly recommend it. I've been trying to get hold of a print of it because I want to show it to an audience because I watched on DVD and it's just
 obscure but it was for quite a while quite difficult to get hold of is Dario Argento's four flies on Grave Albert which is I think
 And then the title itself, I probably shouldn't tell you what the title refers to because it kind of gives away the
 is like a great warm up to that, basically. So that's a little bit more, a little
 in preparations for hotfires called live like a cop, die like a man.
 And then there's this acoustic duo who are singing sort of sappy
 in this kind of hippie wasteland and it's one of those films it has like it has big dance numbers in it it's got sort of quite a big budget but like amazing bizarre design the choreographer
 And then years later I ran into him in an L.A. and he remembered me and said, hey, how's it going? You're watching your friends, I said, you didn't tell me about the apple.
 I want to know all about the Apple. That's definitely worth watching. It has an amazing ending where it looks like they run out of money or something happened where she just says it's getting to what should be its third act. The film abruptly stops with an intervention by God. Literally like in one scene, one of the characters says Mr. Topps is coming and Mr. Topps sends that to be
 You would watch it and you kind of think this is so cruel. This is like a sort of an extreme prank
 over the prank. So I would say like some people who watch it say oh this film is so cruel and yet there are some amazingly funny bits in it. It's definitely can get on DVD. I'm not sure if I saw it yet, probably, so they do festivals but it's called Windy City Heat and it's
 I would recommend it. I would necessarily condone it. I would never make the movie myself.
 like his French film Point Blank, which I presume is called something else in France.
 You can get it on a BFI DVD and it's actually a short.
 and basically they all die horribly and when each one dies
 I didn't know what the title of it was, I missed the title and then much later I found it was called a Patchies and is directed by John McKenzie. And it's on a BFI DVD called Like Stop Looking Listen, one of those.
 a little known 1995 film called The Fist for the Fingers. It was directed by Edgar Howard Wright. He was 20 at the
 You might look out for a young fresh phase 20-year-old actor, Edgar Wright, who appears in one scene before briefly getting shot. It also features Jerry Beetle, RIP, true, Jerry Viddler is in the movie.
 I believe the director had to make it like pad it out to get to 78 minutes.
 Well, one, thank you for not asking an admin question and be it knows true I am developing a horror movie It's funny because people always ask me if I'm ever gonna do a film of don't and a I wouldn't because I think you've already seen the funniest version of that and be I want to do a straight horror movie and I have this idea for like I guess it's like doing in like an English Jalota movie I really like those kind of dreamy like seven
 get right and this is a hastily written list of my favourite films of 2013 but with a disclaimer because it's what the 26th and November and there are a lot of awards you films that come out in the last couple of months of the year that I have not yet seen so this does not include the following films because I have
 great film short term 12 with Brie Larson who I
 Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, I saw that twice and an amazing
 favorite film of the year. Another film is quite divisive but I loved it is Harmony Karin Spring Breakers which I
 from the year, which I've seen twice on the big screen, would plan to see a third time at the Alphonse of Cron's Gravity, which I think is extraordinary, and I recommend
 I can't quite believe it, either, actually, it was like, because it actually was a very pleased with the end result, but I found
 you know, how do we do it in 12 weeks with all the fight scenes? And I said, well, you know, the tradeoff is to get to shoot like
 going to happen. And then we tried, once we had what the scene was, we tried to
 Sydney and I was sitting on the plane and I think it was around the time that Super Bear was about to come out and I was thinking about that film and the
 I see myself in Gary King a little bit as well and I sort of think sort of like that you've got to have sympathy for your characters because even though the character, like the sound players, is like a walking car crash of a man, you know, he's still like, he hits rock bottom but he still kind of rises up to be a hero. That's important is that you've got to kind of like, we don't write characters that we don't have any
 that two weeks ago, so it still feels pretty fresh to me.
 And it's always funny when people watch a new film and they say so what's next I said why don't you just watch this
 We literally just finished it like at least least hold up to like about three or four
 So I feel I feel I feel very nice in terms of life
 film that make me quite kind of like emotional or just watching them in a way because
 You know, I think in a similar way to Sean, it gets kind of, as well as it being like, funny and action packed. It gets kind of a bit deeper, emotionally sometimes.
 friends who have a rift and I think a lot of people have that experience of like sort of the people that you thought when you were 19 you were going to be best friends with forever maybe you're not as close anymore and it's really a film about
 Well, the the theme of nostalgia in the movie is obviously very strong. It's almost like it's Gary's worst enemy if anything the villain of the piece in the movie is nostalgia because like Simon's character Gary came
 it's convinced that he wants to relive his 1990 glory days and it's that thing of that you should be careful what you wish for because when they do attempt to recreate it things go badly wrong and also
 you know what the film is about is that sort of the difference between your kind of like rose tinted like sort of memory of the past and the reality of it and so and then once you add alcohol into the mix it becomes like this kind of like time machine sending you back to being teenagers again. So it's definitely the whole film is like a bit of a
 in terms of like the other actors in it it was definitely important to us that it wasn't so much about well this a couple of things you're right about space is that the one person from space you hadn't been in any
 and we had written a role for him in showing the deadress, then got cut out. He didn't shoot it, we just cut it out of the script.
 And then we want to also make sure that the people who were in the first two movies, one and two like Hoffa's and Sean would also be in this one.
 I think it's because I grew up in a small town in England, you know, like wells in Samuset where I grew up is very pretty
 so as a result I feel like sort of like most of the films I've made have some larger form of escapism in them in terms of in space is no different about like here's my Monday
 And this is different in a way in terms of it's actually sort of like, you know, the start of the movie.
 epic night as being like the sort of the most action-packed night ever and then the irony is when he tries to recreate it it really becomes
 It only really comes to challenging when it comes into marketing and stuff because I think if you had to cut together a trailer that said it was just about friends drinking in the pub then I think a 20th of the audience would go
 So you have to at least hint that there's going to be some kind of like sort of you know like big scale kind of action and special effects so there's lots of there's lots of things that aren't in the trailer that we have kind of kept to ourselves but you know you've got to put enough action and special effects into the trailer so people will come
 So it was that there was there anything you had to cut out and I was thinking well not really I think we kind of went we went for it. I mean my main thing I definitely though what I mean is the
 you know, it makes it very kind of like a challenging to kind of try and make it
 as it is. So I kind of feel like that as a film fan. I sometimes I watch some summer films which you hear about that cost like two hundred million and you watch it and you're going, where did it go? Why do they spend it all on that one
 something and so I'm you know like with this film I just thinking I just wanted to make sure that
 like some people would it's the same way that some girls don't like being called cute it's like oh you're really cute say I don't like that word there's the same way that some guys are saying oh you're so nice it's like I want to be nice I want to be like I want to be a terrible
 Some of that stuff is the wetter boys.
 Make the plot and the characters work so some of the kind of snowy stuff and some of the references like say the kind of you know the crab with gold
 I was wondering if they had opened it in the match at the end, but a lot of that stuff is the wizard of wetter, kind of putting tint and references into the corner of every frame. I guess the sort of if there's a favorite one, I think Herge drawing, tint and portrait right at the start.

 I would be stuck on that line in Interfegas Square and I would know that particular issue of time
 It would mean nothing anymore, because I'd just be on that lion, that'd be my little, kind of, the little sort of safe haven that's going to last for, like, 72 hours. And then I would probably give myself up to the zombies. I'd be so, like, hungry.

 I remember Johnny Depp having to talk about how he takes risks and chances in having to create a character.
 This might work or might not, you know, when we played Jack Sparrow.
 When I did Napoleon and I played Pedro Sanchez, I put Bustard Keaton and my ex-girlfriend's dog together. And I thought, okay, maybe this is my work, but when I met John here as Napoleon,
 the choices that I made and with the help and the propagandist and the director.
 sometimes in films you see a lot of the actors and they're always playing the same type of character but that's who they really are and that's great
 Yeah, that's fun too, you know, but I read a lot. I'm at home watching Brando Flick.
 you know, from Farman, Marlon Brando, to Berkondromontoban, to Roll, Julia. You know, even the actors of my generation, you watch Heath Ledger, and you can watch his
 And Pedro, he's such a character that's loved by so many fans, you know. And because of film, it's such a wonderful story. You know, we're families can sit together and enjoy, from coast to coast, or from all over the world, actually. And that's great. You know, my friend sent me a picture from Israel that there was a science in both for Pedro. And it was like, somebody has spray painted on the wall, my face. And I felt like, wow.
 So, so even now, after seven years, when people approached me, people are nervous and scared and they want to hug me, they're like, oh my god, your bedroom, like, oh my god, yeah, sure.
 I'm lucky to play a character that people love as opposed to playing the villain where I don't want to get, you know,
 You know, and you embrace it, you go, hi, I do. And they're like, okay, what's your real name?
 And the animated series, you get to explore not only Napoleon and the world, but every single character.
 Every episode you get to see different skills. There's an episode where you see Pedro and he's seeing there's any plays guitar and I thought well all right they go can you do it?
 There's ghosts. People can blow up, you know, the world could go on fire.
 but because it's so packed and it's so flip and hot, so I'm like,
 And it took one guy to say, Pedro, and I got from Barton's form. It was cool, but it was just weird.
 No, I got bombarded in the form. It was cool, but it was just weird.
 OK, hey, get out of the way, punk. So, but the security had to show up and they had to pull my best run I mean.
 Still all these years later and I mean they're fans and it's comic cons so you can bombard them no matter what
 You know, as actors, but when the movie blew up as it did, we're going
 I would say that even after having to do a panel and we were sending autographs for hours, there was still a huge line.
 For me being able to send as many regards as possible whatever wherever they wanted because they're I mean, they're it's kind of a kind of die-hard
 grateful of having to see that. You know, because you're thinking, wow, this movie came out seven years ago. It's another fact that we're going to be a part of not only are we animated, and I'm only going to animate the animated series, but it's part of animation domination. Yeah. You're going, this is, we're in good hands.
 Comic Con itself, I remember John here having to talk about how he, as of the panel, he was walking to Comic Con and he got bombarded.
 the steam punk. And at the time, I was like, they're the dead. I painted my face. People were bumping into me going, hey, get out of the way, punk, witches.
 Which is common behavior. Yeah, I just felt bad for those people who are in those suits because
 Yeah, as a matter of fact, I would like to see my character cross over to the Simpsons and then over to
 I did an episode of American Dad, actually. I played one of the girls of Boyfriends, and the whole gang there. I mean, everybody, even with the Fox family,
 So, you know, I always worry about other studios because I know they want to get to the animation domination.
 I'm in all the episodes and I think one of my favorites
 I would say, well, there's two of them. There's Thunder Kong, where you can see Napoleon's fighting skills.
 How we go about that and then there's the other one where it becomes Liger Town where all the Liger
 Animals can talk, ghosts can happen, people can blow up my head to blow up and it's okay.

 Sometimes it could be a lonely road. You know, we need somebody who can say, you know what? Keep doing it. This is the right direction.
 big tools to get you from point A to point B. So something like the SAP
 Well, I'm actually working on a show called the Span and Down for HBO with Danny McBride and Stephen Little and Will Farrell. So, but I'm here actually to support the Sinisterle Film Festival. I got one of the films called Pants on
 That's right. And there's actually several other films. They've got a film from Argentina that's going to be airing tonight.
 And then there's several workshops. There's a workshop that's been done by Arlene who's actually in Grey's Anatomy where she talked about making it in Hollywood. And for those of you guys who are really interested in being in the business, I think it's a great
 to not only hear it from an actress, but to hear her perspective, because I believe she's from this town.
 the glam life and the Hollywood life where you want to talk about going to the parties and mean directors, but and that's great. But the truth is it starts off in your college or it starts up with community where you
 these short films to independent films and grow on to making big future films. But it's a quality of work and a lot of people think about just writing something and throwing it
 I think it's really sitting down with great mentors who understand the business and understand the art. And if you put those two together and really create something great, then it will be big. I could put my soul into that.
 So one of my nerdy geeky thorns is the fact that I am truly a big fan
 And besides, it's a comedy and many people watch generations to sit down watching and enjoy.
 You just like the impact of words you you you you would hope that any work you do will
 But just because she's a personality actress, you know, she's an entertainer. And this role was tailored for her where she gets to play.
 she said for your home, your house will be part of it. I'll get you towels and she hasn't got me towels yet.
 I love you I really did and I said and I remember when you said I'm not gonna vote
 You know what, I understand, but here's my reason. When I was up on stage, I'm rapping.
 And then some of the lyrics had a lot of bad words and the studios couldn't tell me
 We're here at FedExpo 2014 or 2014.

 When you go to the events, for instance, some like this, they've been able to see not only the action figures, but you see the plus dolls and the bubble heads. I mean, for the t-shirts of the book, they go to the hats, the wristband.

 with their extra-nabical pig, otherwise known as Darren. When the two of them got together, they've just spent their whole lives together. They've never really grown up. They're just like kids. Really excited. They do the same things they've always done. They don't let the outside world in.
 they're just in their own little world and completely unaware of anything else that's going on. There's a lot of energy to both of them.

 mad than she is but he never gets to express that because she's always there to bring him back to kind of reality in a way. She's also a lot deeper than like more in touch with her feelings and
 but he's just, you know, everything's just kind of black and white. So it's kind of hard to talk about the character's separate because they're so close together. Do you know what I mean?
 kind of routine, they play the same games, they have these role plays that they play the whole time.
 We're just like the games that kids will play. We play that game again. Yeah, okay, and they're into the game, you know, and you grow a way to that as you go.
 of their world, and when they get to the palace, it's going to be amazing.
 King and Queen of their world. So I think that Runt knows she will get to the palace eventually.
 I just found it really strange, but then after that I got into us and just completely fell in love with it and yeah, like I'm a complete sucker for it
 There's a big difference to this one. The base of it is a complete love story.
 It's it gets very dark and it gets really interesting in that way and because
 reflects a lot of relationships in the sense that, you know, when you first meet someone, your relationship keeps growing and growing, whatever relationship it is, like, especially like with a boy girl, and when you get past a certain stage, if you're not prepared to keep changing with the relationship, if one person says the same, you know what I mean? If they don't change together,
 It's gonna end. One person might want what the other one doesn't and that happens all the time and then
 and as well because it's so intense and it is unhealthy because they haven't developed properly
 She can see her even when she's reading back over, you know, with the sides, you know, for doing the scene, and she's kind of thinking of maybe to add something else to it.
 I don't think it's a matter of age, it's just a matter of understanding.
 I don't know, once you can feel the story, because a lot of people would read us and just knock at it at all because of the way it's written, and then you need to see it performed, whereas other people
 I'm Elaine Cassidy and I play Lucy Honey Church.
 love-ish and she's quite, yeah, experimental. I suppose, yeah, Lucy, she comes from a family
 John Wakefield and she hasn't been back to the island in that time, so the only thing that brings her back is her friendship for Henry. There's no way she's going to miss that wedding, so that shows how strong they're
 So she has to face a lot of past issues that she hasn't dealt with that she's kind of ran away from.

 Pleasantly surprised and entertained.
 I think she should know exactly what's going on and where we are in the story.

 Angela Robel, otherwise known as Kelly, she's Adolf's half niece because her mom is his half sister.
 you know, if they walked into a restaurant and everyone would stop and stare. And I think she quite enjoyed that. So in the beginning of their relationship, it was a lot of fun, a lot of excitement, living with her famous uncle, you know, and coming from a poor family. So she got
 and time with that character so I got to know Gellie really well and every day you spent time with her they seemed to be freaky but so
 just because she's so full of life and it was just a real, it was just like being a rain sunshine every day. It was just so refreshing to be a rainder. But then towards the end of film and
 We had quite difficult scenes to do, Canon myself. And they got quite intense. And for the first time ever, I wanted to escape a character.

 an easy scene and they had to be quite well worked but with Nick the director who's absolutely brilliant and with Ken I just you know we blocked the scene and then because he's just so brilliant it just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time.
 so slight and I suppose you could just read it you know once read it one way and then another time read it another way and Nick was brilliant because he pinpointed moments and we tried it a few different ways and so in each scene you just you felt
 should be international. You know when someone has a story to tell it's universal generally and it is interesting to think that your voice might be dubbed you know and I've listened to it before when I was on a plane once and there was a film that I

 three. John Wakefield went on a killing rampage and killed six people and her mom was one of the six. So her relationship with her dad
 diminishes and he sends her to LA to her grandmothers.
 tried to get on top of it all, and she has run away from a lot of things. The relationship with her dad, she hasn't spoken to him in all that time.
 and how the characters interact and then how the events kind of turn out and how they react to those events, then that kind of came
 Well, yeah, that's when then people can do pools and decide who they think the killer is and why and I mean the amount of conversations we had because
 Well, I think different people will get different things from it, and I think they throw a lot of things out there.
 the beginning to make you kind of confused as to what's going on. But, um, but yeah, I mean, you know, we were just, we'd get a script and then we'd be eager for the next one and we're like,
 I suppose it's it's most similar to reality shows, you know what I mean? Because it was originally pitched as that and it's and and and the way it was shot, you know, everything was
 much better great-grandmother. I mean about her mother and the only kind of raw model of a woman that she has is a great-grandmother. So I think that's why she's a bit, that's why she's so naive and innocent and a bit kind of backwards
 She's never kissed a boy and like, you know, her friends have what she hasn't.
 Because the only woman she has is two generations. I'll do that. And she meets, so when she meets Johnny,
 through, it's a different story. So when he goes away, she finds out she's pregnant four months later and tells her dad and her dad, like he loves her so much, but he just, he's so annoyed that, you know, it's against a religion and
 all that so she kind of feels that she has to go and find Johnny to make everything okay and she goes over to Bram and him to find them but it's harder than what she thinks she
 because she takes everyone on base value. Also, when she tells them that she's pregnant
 and you know, wishing that maybe her father had reacted like that instead. So it's kind of like she's seen the bits of her father and that her father
 he's not bad to her. You know what I mean? He just has his way of bringing her up.
 So then I was going to get myself into the frame and mind of her because she's quite different to me.
 If I had an idea, I wanted to change.

 He wants something more so he'll just say a few keywords and then it gets you back on track kind of and he's really good
 So it was created by written by, starring, executive produced by, directed some, wrote some of the music, all by Dennis Lee.
 So I play his love interest and his backup singer and percussionist.
 So back in the day when this was happening, there were four of us living together, three women and Dennis's character, Johnny Rock.
 for sure and then you know now present day he has a daughter show up that none of us knew he had and she wants to be famous and we're like yeah right let's just
 has money. So she has money. Yeah. And then it turns out she's actually Uber talented.
 And Dennis is so, he's such a sport about really just the self-deprecation.
 Well, he he describes it as he created the show based on some guys who who didn't quite make it, you know, and thought that that was sort of more interesting. Yeah, and that side of it. So there are
 in the show whose characters did make it and then but he didn't so it's that you know Monday morning armchair
 And even more than that, I think it's relatable to anybody who has a family.
 And you know, if you're a human, you come from some form of dysfunction. And that's really what this show is about is kind of one big dysfunction.
 Take it from somebody who got their molars very early in life. Being in love is a fantastic mystery that takes
 and beautiful is not a crime, you know. And for your 4-1-1, I adore your father.
 I hate to break it to you, Angel, but you are no longer the only girl in Nick Parker's life.
 Well, I'm on the host committee for Stars for Stripes, and I'm a big animal advocate, so I'm right at home with this. I've worked with Katie.
 for and then a documentary that she has in the works and then I am on the board of several
 And I know that's not the most appetizing sound bite here, but um
 It's Katie's project and I don't know where things are you know with it I just know that I was one of several experts that she interviewed about Sort of animal rights and and what's happening with them and particularly with Spain
 Oh my gosh, a lot. Okay, so I have a Christmas movie coming out called Anything But Christmas. And then right after that, I'll be Scott Beos' ex-wife on his new show, Sea Dad Run.
 But my pet project are every pun intended, really. I'm launching a new animal project called the pet matchmaker and we launch in January. It's a multimedia project. It's a huge project, so I'll be getting the word out about that.
 I think the best place right now is to come to me. Twitter, Elaine, for the number four animals, and then my website, ElaineHendrick.com.
 Really did Dennis say because Dennis and my character are like we're all about sex, but he said wrong
 I'm so excited for you to meet them. I play Ava. Johnny Rock played by Dennis. His longtime girlfriend and backup singer. And we've had a wild ride together. We've done everything, seen everything, and then some. And along the way, I have stuck with him no matter how dysfunctional he gets. And it's just, it's real love. It's true love. And I do everything I can to protect
 It was pretty kick-ass when we were at like Irving Palace or I mean Irving Place Plaza, Irving Plaza.
 long weekend, Irving Plaza, or the Apollo, all these plays
 And a very dysfunctional family, but a family. And I mean, let's face it, if you're a human, you understand dysfunction on some level. So I think there's going to be something in there that everybody can relate to.
 Ava's, that's her thing. She committed to the Rock and Roll life.
 through and through. So they are committed to each other. They've seen everything
 you're going to get to see that really she wanted a family all these years. Despite all the drugs and the sex and the rock and roll, she wanted a family. And now she gets to have that when Johnny Rock has a daughter who shows up that they never knew he had. And then there's also a really fun spoiler alert that I'm not going to give in the very final episode that when I read it, when I saw the script
 tracks. But then once we got going, the guys, John Corbett already knew how to play the guitar, John Ailes who plays bass, he learned how to play the bass, and then Robert Kelly who plays drums, he learned how to play the drums. So by the end of our 10 shows for this first season, everybody was playing
 I just did a lot of research on rock and roll. I did a lot of research on drugs that she probably would have
 done anything other than prescription drugs that I've needed for various surgery or whatever. But I'm very pro, like I'm very pro marijuana, actually, but yet I've never smoked marijuana.
 friendship and loyalty and so it's you know rescue me which Dennis did years ago and had such huge success with it was a one hour drama with comedic elements and now we're doing a half hour comedy with some dramatic elements to it so it is very very funny
 Dennis, like with through it all the way, he would give us a script and then say come in and he
 going on at all times. And so it was a very messy and raw. And I think that's what
 And Joan Jett is coming to our set to do a scene. And she was awesome. Like she's just a cool change.
 And she played herself, but like it did involve some acting and so she was great and she was game and
 most it's Dennis Leary. I think that's kind of what all of us were drawn to. I mean, he's so specific in his style, he's so successful, and he's just a great guy. He's a really great guy to work for.
 And he, over the years, just, he knows a lot of people and he's stayed in touch with a lot of people. So, you know, really kind of, it just involves a phone call for him and then if someone's available.
 of the show. It makes it very specific. It gives it its own
 is that particularly the men in the rock industry like choose a look and then they stick with it. And so Johnny Rock chose a look and he has stuck
 good all the time. And Ava has kept it but given it a more modern touch. So it's fun because even like there's no off switch with
 Like that, it just, it, it doesn't happen. Except for insects and drugs.
 Good question. First person who pops into my mind who I get likened to frequently and I take it as a great compliment would be Charlize.
 intimate a little loosely, you know, I've now intimately worked with them.
 And Liz has said that before, and I don't see it. I just don't see it. And maybe it's because I've worked with them both.
 Yeah, so I don't know but you know that just it's I guess you know in the eye of the
 It's great for animals, but it's also great for your health, because we're really not built to consume as much meat as we do in modern days. So if people knew what was happening to animals, if they really knew and if they really absorbed it, I believe they would make different choices. And a lot of it's just getting people
 on the eating front, that people, that somehow it taps into like this survival and this fear of, no, I have to eat meat through survive. And then it does become a habit. Like, no, I need this. And you actually really don't. You really, really don't. You just need protein. But that protein does not have to come from animal sources. So yeah. And I had another thought.
 years ago I made what I call the fortunate mistake of watching an undercover fur video and it
 recently honored at the National Animal Rights Conference with their Guardian Award, and also with a Telly Award for my work on
 It's a funny thing getting an award, because it's not really about me, it's about the work, and I just happen to be the
 stream to merge my work in entertainment and my work with animals because I believe that we can end animal suffering.
 and a lot of like drama inside that comedy, which of course is what makes it funny because it's just so absurd and so kind of real and in this crazy dysfunctional world.
 insanity and I think everybody just kind of wants to be a part of that. It's like going
 I my function is really like to help protect him usually from himself But really like he goes off the cliff. I'm going off
 Gillies who plays Dennis' daughter on the show and everybody is playing live instruments and we are sex and drugs and rock and roll.
 But I think I'm going to be here in Los Angeles. I'll be in New York the good the days before for the premiere and press and whatnot, but I think I'm going to come back here and have just a little gap
 We're so comfortable with each other and I think actually in our own weird way, we're very much in love.
 Yeah, and Hollywood and and then that changed it and and I started focusing and acting and now
 You know, I am, I like to think of myself anyway as a good, happy person who likes to help others and be positive. And so I get to really exercise that shadow side of myself who's not so
 Yes, well my organization is the pet matchmaker. Yeah, and we inspire and celebrate rescue fostering adoption of homeless animals.
 I mean, there are so many parts to that that were just disturbing from the alleged killer, luring him out of a protected area to what they did to the lion

 The motion capture actress for Alex Wesker in Resident Evil Revelations 2 and you are
 I was hired for a video game and actually I didn't even know what the game was and I went in and I had to do all these wardrobe fittings and
 had no idea what the game was and it wasn't until this
 2015 that I started getting messages and started seeing images of Alex West
 360 and then they put all these different like probes on me.
 I have been a big fan of the original. I think it's a really neat story. I was first introduced to the series when I was filming in Australia. I was doing a Walt Disney movie called Inspector Gadget 2 there. And some castmates and I were just hanging out.
 of course, seeing the movies and what not. But then, when the revelations came up, I actually haven't played it yet.
 haven't seen it in its entirety. I've been getting all kinds of messages though and seeing fan art a lot from my
 I think it's really cool to be a part of this franchise and I'm super, super
 I thought it was really cool and I think I did a great job of capturing me.
 Playing an evil character playing a game that involved you know a certain level of violence But again, I didn't know what game it was when they hired me with all top secret
 So they didn't tell me a whole lot, but I just knew that I was going to be evil.
 it was really fascinating, I thought it was a lot of fun, and the fans have been incredible. I would also love
 Thank you. I'm a big believer. My acting style is bringing physicality. I'm a classically trained dancer.
 And so that's just what I do for every role and that ends up
 This is the type of film that, as an actor, if I saw on the screen, I'd be like,
 sneering into my heart right now is my own animal rescue organization that I'm a founding member of called Animal Rescue Corps. And we do large-scope rescues like puppy mills, hoarding, dog sled, and sled dogs.
 animal rescue organization that I'm a founding member of called Animal Rescue Corps.
 That's taking up a lot of time, but it's so worth it.

 AC, right at the beginning of the film, so that was kind of, you know, that was very difficult and it took us quite a while to kind of find the right balance.
 definitely and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with CGI and special effects and there's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's a

 Well, it was a sort of long process really and I went for my first audition and I just read the
 like a series of auditions after that and then a series of workshops and then they offer me the part. So it was a long process but it was thrilling and sort of the adrenaline you get from it and it's
 I mean, making this movie was so much fun. I mean, I loved absolutely everything.
 Anything really, I mean, just anything that's classy and that I know that I'm really going to enjoy something
 really get stuck into it. I'd quite like to do like an action film which has a bit of sword fighting or something and it's just something that I've not experienced yet.
 really great position where I can kind of pick and choose what I wanted and I started getting offers to do a lot of big studio movies and none of the scripts excited me and I just started looking at different things in the world that were disturbing me and I'd seen this website where you could go to Thailand and pay $10,000 to walk into a room and shoot somebody in the head and that idea disturbed me so
 so much. I said screw this, I'm just going to write, direct, produce, do my own movie, have complete, you know, creative
 and after he saw the movie he invited me to his house to watch movies and I think we're watching more of the Gargantua's or Hell Night or some old film and we started talking about different
 You gotta write that right now. So I just ran home, unplug my phone, shut off my
 Yeah, it was great. I mean I grew up in Boston and there's a certain type of guy from Boston. We call it mass
 And the guy, I drink them, I mean, you know, I went to, I live with those guys and I got beat up by those guys and it was one of those guys. So a lot of the times, you know, when you're on set, you can kind of act like that and be like, dude,
 But Quentin loved it. I mean, Brad was Aldo and I was Donnie. The marriagey, the whole time. And there was a P.A. named Karla. And I was like, Karla!
 these guys in my head for eight years and now I get to hang out with them. This is so cool. So but you know the beating scenes it was very cathartic to get that out of your system but you know the truth is that when I'm filming a death scene I get happier and happier as the day goes on as I'm getting my shot
 conjure up the most painful, darkest stuff from your entire life and bring it right to the surface, like it just happened 10 minutes ago. So I noticed at the end of the day, I was just drained. I don't want to talk to anybody. You just want to crawl into a hole and die and then get up and do it again the next day. So certain days were fun, but on the days when I had to kill somebody, it was really, really much more intensive
 thing that you were never supposed to do. But, you know, there was a real purpose to it. I mean, this wasn't for shock. This was, and, you know, and we were shooting going, okay, this has to hang within Gloria's bastard. So, I got to bring it as
 Facebook, maybe these social media, but, you know, if you're, you know, 14, 15, 16, or in your early 20s and you've grown up with that, you know all these different tricks. You're your home mentality of how to use social media and how to use a phone.
 It's completely different and what's terrifying to me to someone in their 40s is that there is nothing private anymore. There's a whole generation that's grown up with no concept of privacy.
 But we grew up in this era where kind of all of your behavior, for me, before
 It's not recorded, thank God. So, I wanted to show what can happen. What terrifies me is the idea that, you know, in the time of fatal attraction, you could do something like this. Maybe your wife found out, maybe your people at work. But now, if you misbehave, you cheat on your wife, you do something wrong. It can literally be broadcast to the whole place.
 together. I go, well, we really need to start prepping a week. He's like, what? I go, yeah, we have this house and these people moved out and we have all this art experience because are you two insane?
 It was a combination of several events. One, I was watching the old 70s cannibal films.
 never make that movie today because the jungle's not there anymore. It's gone. It's all disappearing. I thought, okay, that's my end.
 to protect the jungle to stop, you know, the uncontacted tribes. But at the same time, Occupy Wall Street was happening. And during Occupy Wall Street, there was a relative of mine who was occupying. And I remember he graduated college and I was like, oh, is he working? What's he doing? And my mom was like, oh, no, he's occupying. And I was like, well, what's he occupying against? I mean, he hasn't really been screwed over by anybody. He grew up in a nice family and went to college. And I'm like, well, he goes to his friends, they meet girls, you know, that's what he do. And I just thought, okay, all right, great.
 on Daryl Sabara when he's like ping and there's a tarantula. That's a real poisonous tarantula, that's probably mine. So everybody in the cast fully, fully went for it. And I think that's one of the reasons the movie really works. When you see them, they're in the dirt and they're surrounded by pig shit and they're getting bit by bugs. There's no makeup there.
 Like we had to send cast members to the hospital. We had to take yellow fever shots. We had anti malaria pills. We had to get deparacited after
 Amazon it was crazy when the girls when the kids drop a snake on Kirby and Magda's face that is a real snake that was I was standing there and the kids turn around they're like they're like oh the kids have an idea and they had a baby python and that I was like what do they want they go well the kids start to be funny if we threw it in the cage with you know the Americans and I was like actually that's a great idea we're gonna do that and so we did the take
 And I look at the TV freeze frame at the things like two inches from fighting your face. So it's just that kind of a shoot. But you know what?
 and I you know you told me the story and I said I will do anything to help you make this movie and we write the screenplay and bring it to our partners Eric Newman and Mark Abraham who are fantastic producers and you know made a lot of great movies and then we take it to Universal with that team and then we bring on Bill Cawing the core UN comes on for the fights and it just snowballs from there
 not just seeing another fight, you're moving the story for it but you're really unfolding another corner of this world with oh wow okay that's the roads okay these guys go underground that's really cool okay these are the falcons they live in the trees and you know it's jungle village we wanted to really create a unit
 universe, that's what we spent a year and a half in the writing, thinking of every clan, thinking of their weapon, thinking of what their relationship is with other clans, so that there's
 You know, also the rhythm, the rhythm of the dialogue. I mean, there was a lot. But, you know, it's really kind of harnessing what he did with Wu Tang. He really was able to produce all of that and really bring in Dave Batista and Russell Crowe and Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa and Crambler. All these people from all these different worlds, you know, everybody coming together and kind
 and that's okay because to me it was always make believe and pretend and I always thought no matter what I'm doing on a movie set there's nothing worse than what's going on in the real world I mean people
 And he said, oh, they're just pigeons. I said, these are creatures. These are animals. And I actually remember the guilt-shipping.
 I couldn't be in the house anymore. I couldn't be friends with this person knowing that these people left their dog out there suffering. And they had a sadditude, whoa, it's just a dog. But you could see how upset this animal was. So I had very, I'm always very, very affected by violence in real life. And certainly violence against animals.
 all in good fine, I guess you could say. But I wanted to use that attention that I get.
 where this hobby we had collecting all these cards, we now have them, but we just, like, I don't know what
 in December of 2004. And then after, like, you know, we kind of spent the day going through the script, he goes, hey, you want to hear a scene from him going to the bathroom?
 around April of 2008, while he was writing it, using my passive or satire with all my friends and boss to
 he calls me and asks me to go grab some food with them. So we're dinner and he's like, look, Dono, it has to be a real character. This isn't death group. It's got to know this is like your best friend. It's got to be 360 degree person who's his parent. And I was like, well, quite a night, I wasn't going to do that research until I knew I had the
 He's telling me I'm going to be in a leading-world Brad Pitt. And he's like, yeah, I can do a toast. He's like, yeah, here, cheers. And we just did it. And he's like, that's it. But I dropped everything, put it on 40 pounds of muscle, went to Boston.
 ever wanted to see. It's everything that I had fantasized about visualized.
 It's exactly what you would do. It's like you this dream that you had and you realize that somebody else had that same dream and now you're sharing it with all these other people.
 I'm sorry, that was one of the best screens. It felt like the energy of the red carpet of Cannes was in that room. I've never been to a screen like that. It was like electric.
 I mean, leading up to it, he should have good bad in the ugly, should have the dirty dozen.
 with, like, it's right tail and ship around on the bar firing into a crowd. And when he said the ending, he's like, dark of the sun, dark.
 The business is changing to such a degree that you're finding that movies are kind of small, the O.D. releases or it's Marvel and clearly what audiences are going to and what theaters are booking are Star Wars movies and these kind of event superhero films. So it's certainly there are a lot of fun, you get a lot of money to play with.
 It's interesting. It's a whole other universe that's happening right now.
 I first had the idea to write and direct Cannibal Holocaust.
 Believe what I had just seen and it was before the internet so I couldn't just go up and look up information and I tried to find it in every book and I was I
 actually killed people. And I studied special effects. I'd seen every makeup effect, but I had never seen anything so effective. The filmmaking, the documentary style, and of course, the Riz Ortelani music. And that was what began my obsession with the movie. And of course, reading about Rajero and subsequently realizing that he had directed other movies that I loved as well. But it seemed like he really murdered
 Every review ever by anyone the first
 they talk about is cannibal holocaust, cannibal holocaust, and the Hollywood report
 become over time the gold standard for like it's like the ultimate outlaw horror movie. There's nothing there is no closer
 was going to work and to really start the movie, I was paying myself for my own money to fly the crew to go to Peru. And while we were there, like right before shooting, was when the financing came together. But I had to say, yes, we're going, yes, we're going, we were fighting the weather. And then we were in the jungle and I started production. And every day I was thinking, I really, today I really need to write Rojaro.
 tell him right when I get back in December. But by then, the news had gotten out. And I felt terribly that you didn't hear it from me first.
 Honorable Holocaust is the inspiration and it's a very different type of story and the name of the green inferno, but the idea was I want
 That's kind of ultimate mandu kanibali has the finger thing that you'll see tomorrow night. Yeah, amongst other things, but
 really for a modern American audiences, because it couldn't be as strong as Cannibal Holocaust. It's a different story, but I want you to notice in the credits,
 world and cannibal holocaust. I want people that maybe have never seen it that are too scared to see it to watch green and furno and then go find cannibal holocaust if they haven't
 Okay, I like I like Fitzgerald I like the scenes with the natives when the natives come on the boat. I think
 But the one where we shot is by a gira the wrath of God because they called the pongo a gira and we went far
 But the difference but also for my untrained
 The difference, obviously, I think that what makes Cannibal Holocaust unique that a lot of people don't know is that you are the, everybody knows you are the assistant director to Roberto Rosalini, but not many people know that you are the
 is right in crime novels and detective stories now, and his crime films are incredible. I mean, you made great crime films as well, but when we think of Lindsay, I think of the Italian crime. And if you look at Cannibal
 and in Cannibal Fair Rocks, they're finding a detour. It's more, it's the keep cutting back to New York.
 back to these police, but Lindsey loves the detective stories.
 every single day. There was no electricity, no running water. These people had not only never seen a movie
 There were poisonous snakes and tarantulas. It was the Amazon. It was no joke. It was it was scary at times, but I'm glad we pushed it and did it.
 make me a better director. It's actually much easier to direct, you know, at 40 than at 30 and I feel
 lots of reports of it when we were in Peru, too. Crazy stories. It was insane. And once we were in the jungle, we realized there's a thousand stories in there. It's an amazing place. I mean, you know, cannibalism, it's the last unthinkable thing
 There were awesome. I mean, there were villagers. They weren't like people that you'd expect like they weren't like cannibal holocaust where they're actually people that live in church
 parts into Peru, because people actually ship real body parts. So we had fake heads and fake arms and all that stuff got confiscated by customs. And even though it was fake and we explained it was a movie, it was very hard.
 One is Tarantino directing me. I could turn off that directing hat. I mean, when you're going in as an actor, you know what you're getting into. And I said, I wanted to be the dream actor I wish I had. I just fully threw myself into the part. I put on almost 40 pounds of muscle. I went back to Boston where I grew up and only talked to my accent and created the role and created the character. You know, I just became possessed by really, really giving him
 As long as you know mention 86, it's fine. But the truth is we get mad about the Mets and 86, but the painful things were more mad at Bob Stanley and Calvin Sheraldi. You know, I can't hate the Mets the way I hate the Yankees.
 but a bunch of kids who get a cabin in the woods they go there to have fun and they get this flesh eating disease which rips through their flesh and those horrible things they go crazy in
 movie that was both funny and scary. Where, like in the style of American, we're often London or Evil Dead 2 where you're laughing one minute and just so disgusted you're laughing the next and scared
 you're trapped somewhere in the woods and it's like your friend turns into the flesh-eating monster only this time it's this real disease
 $50 million. So when you're making a movie on that low budget, you've got to be creative. You've got to push the goal.
 You know, you gotta be creative. You gotta push the gore, push the scares. We totally put it the incorrect. Really making it shocking and violent.
 history of human nature, when people get leprosy, they're sent to leper colonies. Smallpox, they're put in isolation. And two years ago, when the SARS outbreak hit China, what did they do? They sealed those people off. They didn't take them to the hospital because nobody knew what this was and nobody wanted to get it. They sealed those people in a building until they figured out what the hell it was. And I think that the kids aren't monsters. I think that they're just behaving the way kids would behave. And that's one of the things that's made the film, I think such a success in America, is
 I like drawing, I like painting. I enjoy doing all these things. I like inventing new ideas. That's why I'm here in Frankfurt. We're meeting with other inventors and scientists and engineers. You know, that's fun. I think I get bored when I do the same thing over and over and I think it makes you more better.
 I like inventing new ideas. That's why I'm here in Frankfurt. We're meeting with other inventors.
 for the main influences are Tobi Hooper's Texas Chancel Masker, John Carpenter's The Thing, Sam Ramey's The Evil Dead.
 old. I mean, I love Nosferatu. I mean, there are, you know, Fritz Lang is one of my favorite directors. I saw him a tropless one.
 when I was in college and I was working for a producer and David Lynch needed research for a project. So it was for David Lynch and Angela Battle and Menti, his composer. And I spent years doing research for him. Then I moved to LA and he called me and he's like, Eli, man, we're going on the net. Davidlynch.com. It's going to be beautiful, man. And I went to his house and he started telling me all these ideas. And I just started shooting this stuff with David Lynch. We're shooting poppots shows, the show with rabbits. And I told him about Cabin Fever, which I had written. And he was really, really helpful
 gave me music you know it's for free just as a favor it was really really cool then I told David Lynch I will do anything for free
 get caught in form. I do it because it's so fun being around that guy. I learned so much about directing action.
 I learned more from David Lynch than any other director. I mean, he's so nice.
 mental institution. He was completely psychotic and this other, the old guy behind the general star with a white beard, he had never been in a movie before. So I thought these people had such great
 other in flavor. Stylistically, I sat down with my cameraman before we shot and we watched Texas Chainsaw Masker.
 I'm asking, watch Lucia Fulcice house by the cemetery. There are certain movies that I
 people who were like that's exactly what happened I saw with a date my date didn't want to sleep alone I took her back to my place and you know I nailed the stuff
 It's called Scavenger Hunt. I have a new company that's producing horror movies called Raw Nerv. We just produced a movie called 2001 Maniac, starring Robert England and played Freddie Krueger. I'm writing a movie with a filmmaker named Richard Kelly who wrote and directed Donny Darko, a popular cult movie.
 place that no cameras had ever been before. So it was pretty crazy. I mean, I wanted to have an adventure
 every single day. There was no electricity, no running water. These people had not only never seen a movie
 There were poisonous snakes and tarantulas. It was the Amazon. It was no joke. It was it was scary at times, but I'm glad we pushed it and did it and
 make me a better director. It's actually much easier to direct, you know, at 40 than at 30. And I feel like
 There was no awareness of a camera. They didn't know what a camera was. So we had to show them and they don't get
 people will come out of the video unless you've seen cannibal holocaust in one of those little girl or Fitzgerald or the old Werner Herzog.
 parts into Peru because people actually ship real body parts. So we had we had fake heads and fake arms and all that stuff got confiscated by
 And even though it was fake and explained it was a movie, it was very hard. It was a crazy time shooting in Peru and shooting in the Amazon. But we went way up the river, farther than anyone's ever gone before. And it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. We had an amazing crew and amazing cast and it really shows in the footage.
 about a couple of American friends with a friend from Iceland that are backpacking through Europe and they're looking for European girls and drugs and all that kind of stuff that can't find in America. And they hear about a hostel in Slovakia that's rumored to be filled with beautiful girls. So they go there and it actually is and everybody hooks up and the girls seem to love Americans and then one of the friends disappears. And it starts to lead to something darker and more sinister and the guys eventually realize they're trapped into something really horrible. It's this really violent journey into hell and
 movie, there's nothing worse than what's going on in New Orleans. I mean, I can put the most violent stuff in a film and people know it's fake. They're paying for fantasy. They've seen the actors
 doing interviews. They know there are a lot. So it allows them to enjoy the violence. What gets people desensitized is when they're school shootings every week. It's when we say, oh, another 10 people are killed in Iraq. When we have this
 horrifying that anything I could ever put in a movie and it's real and that makes people think God you know what there's no police there's no army no one's gonna save us everything's gonna fall apart there's horrible racial tension and nobody's in charge that's what gets people desensitized the more
 was it never really felt like work or started like work. You know, Quentin loved Kevin Fever and invited me to his house to watch movies after he saw it. And we struck up this friendship where, you know, he'd show me old movies like Black Valley of the Tarantula and I was like, oh, dude, you got to see this movie Sean and the dead. And I got him a print of Sean and the dead and introducing to Edgar Wright. So, you know, I was kind of meeting all the young filmmakers and he was showing me a lot of older movies and he really became one of the only people I can trust in Hollywood.
 rock dead Fred with Rick Mail was known as one of the funniest scripts ever written and some Dutch director came in and like didn't know how to use Rick Mail was like a comic
 genius and the movie's a mess. So it's like, it was frustrating for the director, it was frustrating for the writer, it was frustrating for the star, but you know, it just kind of had the wrong ingredients.
 that and I also produce my own movies. I think for me the only way to do it is to write, produce and direct. Because if I write a movie and you give it to a director and they screw it up, it's like
 You know, it's so frustrating. I mean, there's it's like this movie drop-dead Fred with Rick Mayall was known as one of the funniest scripts ever written and some Dutch director came in and like didn't know how to use Rick Mayall was like a comic genius and the movie's a mess. So it's like it was frustrating for the director, it was frustrating for the writer, it was frustrating for the star, but you know, it just kind of had the wrong ingredients. But when you have an idea in your head and I write it, unless it was a director
 The title knock knock came to us actually when we were we were writing the film was Nicholas Lopez our co-writer we're thinking what could we call this?
 knock knock we love the simplicity of it and what it led to and just you know the knock knock joke them knocking on the door them showing up in the middle of the night I'd like a title that gets you thinking and leads other mysteries and it was a very simple title knock
 All of my films are for a very bloody, they're known for the
 in mind. But in this case, we wrote it for Genesis for the Renza Izzo. You know, I'd work with the Renza Izzo on Aftershock and Hemlock Grove and she starred in the Green and Ferno. So we wanted to write a character for her.
 He's warm and sweet and vulnerable and nice and I think what we're seeing now is a huge turning point in Kiana's career. We're seeing what we're going to get for the next year or 30 or another 25 years of leading performances from him. But I want this to be his Oscar nominated performance. I want people to watch Knock Knock and go, oh my God, Kiana was so funny, so wonderful. It's a real, real actress piece. He's just incredible.
 I mean, we love low budget, mainstream at low budget, high quality. We don't want anything to look low budget. So both of us have done movies in our own way. We've learned where to save money.
 the officers and all the stunt people I said I remember the scene in the club there's girls and heels and skirts and I said wow I can't believe Chile is all these hundreds of stunt girls and he's like haha stunt girls green go these are models I was like what I was like they've never been in the movies like no
 Green goes so worried about everything. You're so gringo about it. So then like we close our eyes and we drop sent thank God no one got hurt
 was pinned under the concrete in the cemetery. I looked around and I saw all the graves and there were skeletons and bones and hair and I said, God, the art department did an amazing job. This looks so real and it's a great art department. Like, why? They just let us in an hour ago. This has been closed since the earthquake. They literally opened the door and let us shoot there because there's so many areas that are destroyed that can't use it. We just walked in
 Chris Craven was one of those names that, as you got older, his films grew with you. So, when I was a kid, it was before VCR.
 was the film that your friend's older brother saw, so you'd have them go, oh, that's a movie, and they take the girl
 of Last House and the Left. And it has this kind of Harry Nielsen folk music done by David Alexander Hess. And I remember thinking, like, God, this is 1972 and this is 2002. You couldn't use this music in a movie today. And I thought, that's it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to track down that music. And so I took six songs from Last House and the Left. And I got the guy who plays the killer, who sings these songs. It was his kids did a cover for the end credits. It was something super, super geeky.
 And he saw he heard the last house in the left music and was like, oh my god, this guy's the real deal. And I met Wes and I was like, hi, nice to meet you. Sorry, I stole six times in your movie.
 About five or six years ago, this trailer showed up around Halloween for a movie called Clown, where a guy puts on a clown suit for his kid's birthday party and he can't take it off when he starts turning into this monster. And the hair, he keeps cutting the hair and it grows back and he rips the nose, fuses it. And then it said,
 So even though he hadn't done a feature, his commercials and videos were so smart, he was part of this collective smuggler films and his stuff just looked amazing. Everything he did had that real beautiful clean polish. And I just knew if he applied that aesthetic to a horror film, he'd make something really special. His second film, Copcar, is fantastic.
 But it was it was a pleasure. It's it's nice when you work with a director like John. It's that same experience. I had a Thai West making the sacrament or Daniel stand during last exorcism where you can just really be there as support but just
 Grim's fairy tales going back hundreds of years. I mean those are the oldest horror stories there are and there's a reason we've been telling them for
 Eating my witches and eating my trolls. So when you're dealing with clowns, I think what makes clowns creeps
 that they are around children and that we do let them around children and that when we as children are so fascinated by them that you think oh my gosh this is a grown man that we let around kids just because they have clown makeup on and then
 someone could, you know, use that to do horrible things to children. So I think that's where clowns started to get a bad name as being creepy. And there hadn't really been a horror film in a while that explored that. And I think that what John came up with that was so clever is the idea that it's not the
 It's easy, but it's the suit that's evil. Once whoever puts this on is going to transform it into this thing. And in that way, it really becomes much more like the fly. And that's what I thought was brilliant. Was there way in to tell this story that it's not just, okay, clowns are scary. Let's make a scary movie. But what if you were just a dad trying to do the right thing to help your kid and you dressed up like a clown? Because the clown you wanted didn't show up to the birthday party and you just put on the wrong clown suit.
 you really feel for this guy as he's trying to resist the urge but you know we wanted to stay true to the fairytale mythology and that's what we made a movie that was you know probably
 You want to have some sort of message underneath it. I never like to go to the movies and have a history lesson forced down my throat, but I love when I'm watching gory movies over and over and watching people's heads be ripped off and guts get torn out.
 told me about this earthquake that hit in February 2010 in Chile and it was an 8.8
 Basically society collapsed where he said it was whole generation their iPhones went out so nobody knew anyone's phone numbers and without GPS nobody knew how to get anywhere And he was he called his girlfriend in the phone. She's like, yeah, I'm at the coast. Oh, there's just a tsunami
 I had heard he was auditioning at people for it. And then the night before he leaves for Berlin, he's like, hey, man, I'm starving. You want to get some food? I'm like, sure, I knew he was making his movie. I hadn't bothered him.
 And am I going to be in a movie with Brad Pitt as the bear Jew in this? I'm going to do the bat. He's like, yeah, I'm like, can we have a toast? He's like, yeah, here, cheers. Listen, it's got to be a
 about that. And so I sat down at dinner with them, but literally then, and then I was like, well, and then I said,
 killed and so it's like their parents were in America but everybody had cousins that were things that like they grew up watching everyone coming back into 50
 It's different. It's care like I have a you know BMW like it's okay. You can get him or say he's now. It's a different. It's like the generation. They've really it's they're all the generation for them is dead and the new people and I brought my parents over. It was a very moving experience. They were like we should have come over sooner. This is the best thing for anyone Jewish go to Germany. People are wonderful. It was great and we're sitting at the premiere.
 parents, we all just burst into tears. It was some weird, even though we knew it was pretend. As my father said, there was the historical reality and the emotional reality.
 connected with everybody. So that's Quentin now. He's so tuned into these things that you just, you know, that everyone's
 I did animation and I sang that song. My friend Noah Belson and I were watching this
 Yeah, my dad was great. My father's a psychoanalyst. It was a professor at Harvard recently retired. But my parents were great. My mom's a painter. They took me to all kinds of movies. They believed I should be allowed to see anything. I never saw movie violence as real. I always saw it.
 You know, I went to go see Alien with my dad and I was like so terrified I was eight years old that was freaked out and then at the end so going to we ever start taking her clothes off
 And my parents looked at me like, are you going to throw up? And just my parents were looking at me. It was psychosamount. I was like, and I ran down the aisles and projectile vomited over like three rows of people.
 It's like a monkey pie, buddy. Dumps a bucket like you're with your date and it's just
 Cukes on you and then runs out and I remember my mom like following me in the bathroom. I'm like mom you keep with the men she's like no more harmonies
 Well, when it pleases Toronto film festival, we had two ambulance calls, which was great. One person passed out and one person fainted on the escalator and rolled down, which is great.
 two girls who can't physically overpower Keanu have to have him tied up. They've done it before. I mean, they're not like boy scouts. They understand it. But I need him to be tied up in a way that it looks like these girls did it and he really can't move. So we also wanted to look kind of cool. You know, you got to make sure they just
 Yeah, it's been great. I have a good team. You know, it's fun. It's like a whole or whole chili wood crew with Nicholas Lopez, Garamon, Widow, our team.
 in Chile and of course Lorenza and Ignacio and Aaron Burns, the whole cast.
 Exactly. Well, that's the whole idea is that I wanted to use the camera work to tell the story and to show character. And there's three kind of moves through the house where we take our time going through. The first time is just introducing everything the second time is at night and the third time is the end one. It's just complete destruction.
 moment here. And it was just such a pleasure to work with Keanu Reeves and you know, find incredible, incredible talent like Ana D'Armas and give her her English language breaks. Amazing, amazing
 Yeah, I know. I mean, there are movies like The Strangers and Funny Games that I really like, but one of the things that struck me about Peter Trainor's death game, which Colin Camp was in in 1975, is a very, very little scene film, but really kind of a masterpiece, is the way these girls show up. There's just a premise of two girls showing up at your house and cheating on your wife, and then they won't leave, and it really unravels your life. And what happens when you lose control
 Keanu lets the vampire in, you know, and fatal attraction, Dan makes the mistake. You know, I won't be ignored, Dan. Like, it's Dan's fault, and that's what's scary. You know, whether it's a hard candy or even Polanski's death in the maiden does a great job. That was a big influence.
 also I'm 43 and the way I would use social media areas Facebook or Twitter anything is completely different than the way 17
 And I remember the Icelanders were like, did you cut your, the American doesn't know how to shave, like they're looking at me, they've come out looking
 In a foreign country, it can be scary going to hospital, especially when you walk into the doctor's office.
 So finally she like she goes can I have a sample of it? I went sure what
 And they were like, game, it was some crazy ringworm infection that I got.
 It was, that's what inspired the movie. I thought, wow, you can be totally healthy.

 Argentina she like the fans are the same they love it and it's really great when you can give
 scary story, second that we're all getting every country has their own monster
 Every country has its own, you know, the ghost and Japan with the girls and the well that hares.
 every country has their own horror stories. And people love it when you can take a classic, like the vampire, where we'll frank inside the monsters and reinvent them in an interesting way. And that's what we thought, Brian McGrevy really did with his novel, Hemakrove. And we wanted to create a series that felt something like a more in the style of David Lynch, Twin Peaks, but almost with a touch of Douglas Cirque, Melodrama, but something that was spooky and stylized, intelligent, and fun. And it was really great.
 of Hemlock Grove. People are fascinated with small town
 American life and we've created, we worked very hard to create a universe that is something special and unique and of course
 or your significant other, it's like a serious offense in a relationship. But no, it was instrumental in the, I wrote a season one when we talked about all 13 episodes going on. It was really changed the way we could write the show. We didn't have to write for commercial breaks. We didn't have to do recaps.
 It's you're right there in your home with your friends you put it on you watch another one and another one and we knew that you know one of the
 look, we love Brian McGreeby's novel and the first season we were fitting 13 episodes to that novel. So there were times you could feel we were stretching, we felt, in watching it after, okay I could feel, this one we stretched it a little bit to get to this story point.
 deep, much deeper into her character, because she's such an incredible actor with such amazing range. We wanted to show all the different layers
 of Olivia and we we fitted to 10 episodes so that everything was story story story but we wrote it knowing that people in general are watching through
 better series than 10. And sort of stretching, having those huge moments like the transformation, obviously we want the
 turns back into a human. What does that look like? We got to see what that looks like.
 We realized that at 10 episodes we were just a little more focused and we could really make each episode like let's focus on making 10 amazing amazing
 episodes and really putting really writing those huge kind of big set pieces that poor people go oh my god I can't I've never seen that done before and everyone it was just a little more manageable it was a little more
 13 worked for the book, but now that we were, you know, creating stories
 on our own without the book, we thought that 10 would be really, you know, let's make 10 really, really good.
 Yeah, let me check works under James Cameron and dark angel like the guy he's he's worked with so he's such an amazing range of experience working with such great producers
 Creators that what was really nice was we had you know, we had the book last year we had
 amazing team last season but it did feel like we didn't have that one so the book was the central voice and we needed one person that could really be the central voice and the filter for all their ideas is I'm gonna have a million ideas but I also don't I also
 that my presence I can't just show up be like hey guys what if we do this like I need to we all agree the best way to work was to everyone kind of filters everything through check and you know I can say what if like
 I'm not saying him, but I was like, what if he, what if like, I want to see what happens to Peter. He's been so careful about being a far goal for like, being aware of like, and just, and where he can transform. And he, it's such a secret of thing that he would only let Roman, so like, what if the beginning of the second season he's just doing it to a bunch of strangers? And we realized just how completely far gone he is and how he just doesn't have a fuck about anything. And checks like, and I was like, what if he's doing it like, just to fuck with some people and he, and checks like, no, man, he's just like, I was like, what if he's doing it like,
 they're hallucinating and think it was drugs and checks like yeah you should be doing it as a gift we're like that's it like it's like it's a drug deal we're using it to like trick people into thinking they're hallucinating to sell drugs to get so fake drugs to get money like and that's what we loved about chick was we could say what happens to you when you're you have
 ability and you force it against the wrong mood. How does that start to make you go insane? What does that wreak have a
 how it was really a metaphor for being self-destructive and going on some kind of crazy drug bench you're not supposed to do.
 understood how to take that idea and immediately incorporate it.
 that you understand why he's doing it. And that's what's great about someone like Chick is he could take any crazy idea we threw at him and really understand how to turn it into story and turn it into character based story. I like to think visually, think of ideas, think of characters this and that. And, you know, Fomf is obviously she's a director and a creator and writer and we all have ideas.
 but check is so experienced and cool.
 love and he's used a great addition to the show. He has his own ideas as well. So it just became one central voice
 and how the network made David Lynch and Martin Frost solve or upon the murder and the frustration it led to.
 really about the people in the town. And then they saw the murder and they had to come up with Windomoral and the black lives.
 explain it's an effort we talked about a three season is three to five season macro arcs of where where the characters are all
 After the first season, we sat out and looked at those macro arcs.
 We had a multi-season plan for where the characters were going
 We're going to go and then we brought in chick who's like completely fresh set of eyes who just watched it as a fan He's like I love the show, but here's where I take it and suddenly you're like oh my god That's actually an amazing idea. So it was a combination of sort of knowing the macro arc of where we were going to go But also seeing what worked and we're like everybody loves the guys here when you see Roman and Peter together
 I ran it to him. He was like, what's good, please tell me shelly isn't dead. Shelly is my favorite.
 You can see there were a lot of people that have that introspective poetic sensitive side
 Well, there were ideas. I mean, Brian McGrady had an idea. We wanted to see if we were going to do a graphic novel of a bridge between season one and season two, and there were, it's still something.
 Some kind of graphic novel or something, you know, it's a whole universe that we love to keep expanding on.
 But it's really up to the fans. You know, fans give a stick with the show and give season to a chance. It only allows us the opportunity to further explore it in many, many ways.
 certain forces. There's a reason everyone is coming to Hemlock Road and there's a much bigger picture at play as to why this town is becoming the four texts for all this particular type of editors.
 I mean, it's something, you know, we want to lay the groundwork for a show that can go for many seasons and explore many
 that loses its potency upon repeated viewings.
 with horror the very thing you go for is that scare and that's the thing once you know it's coming it's never as strong the second time so when you create a show you have to make so much more than that it can't be about the scare it's got to be about the characters and the story the injury the universe the world and those great moments and those great lines and the things they do the way they dress and the way you know it's such a fantastic
 You know, we're laying the groundwork for a really, really rich universe that we want to explore in 200 different directions. But it's really up to the fans at this point if people continue to let
 No, you know, we love the fair reaction, but the fair reaction generally informs with that.
 This is the longest he has his characters in his head for eight years before the show. So now, in fact, that everyone else is, they're a part of that universal creator who loves it.
 those are the people I want to see crash in the jungle and just get eaten because from the point of view the villagers they're just invaders they just see them as people dressed in construction suits tearing up their land and they've crashed in their backyard they're gonna punish them like invaders so that's what's fun for me is the clash of cars
 Where's the why you work? I mean the village had to be a real functioning village and we found this amazing village in Pedro and the whole village got in on the making the movie and they loved it It was it was so much fun a lot We do conceptually explain to this village what a movie was there's so cut off with no electricity many of them had never seen a television before let alone a movie
 Wow, that's great. It's kind of an oddly pro-vegetarian movie, even though I am a big steak eater. I couldn't help it. You know, you see the civilized meat eating in the restaurant where they're cutting the steak and then of course they're in the jungle. And the sad truth is that eventually we all are basically food. We're going to be warm food no matter what, whether we like it
 just want to cause. So more than that, more than any sort of, it was people that just wanted to cause just because they felt they needed one. And that's like a very college thing to do. And it always stuck with me. Those grow the image of those girls sitting there going, this is unfair. We're striking from the janitors. And then on the weekends, they go back to Greenwich to their house.
 Oh, man. I would try and charm them. I would tap dance. I'd be like, hey, I'm the entertainer. I would teach them how to whistle. I think like I could show them really good survival skills. But no, ultimately, I'd be, you know, I'd be done. Now, hopefully I'd be too hairy to eat. Maybe they'd have to like burn me if they want to whack to be like, all right, that's like eating a bear, but they probably have to skin me. I wouldn't last 10 minutes of those cannibals. It was hard enough shooting

 Yes, yes. But of course, the first formative years of
 feeling. And I wanted to channel it somehow. I didn't know. I used to lie on my bed and pretend it was the Sahara and I was in the foreign Legion and I'd get shot in the arm.

 Although people get a lot more acclaimed for movie work than they do for stage work, but the most satisfying for me is doing it on stage.

 together. And Kazan had directed the skin of our teeth and wasn't happy with his direction of fantasy. So he picked a little scene from a one-act play of Williams called Ten Blocks on the Camino Real.
 And he wanted to just work on it as a director. And I was playing in Mr. Roberts. At night after the show was over 1115, we'd meet at the actor studio and we'd work to 1 o'clock in the morning and he directed. Then he showed it to Tennessee. And Tennessee was absolutely astounded at what Kazan had found in a fantasy sense with his scene.
 So he said incidentally they're going to do my play the rose tattoo and he should play Manja Cavallo. So that's how I got to play the rose tattoo.

 Yeah, and the truth of what happened, you know, and the truth of what happened behind this

 She obviously has played a couple of extremely well-known real-life people, and she was talking about it.
 Like very interested in what she was saying because I might be doing that and I
 So good at it, but you don't feel like she's impersonating anybody.

 they both have this sort of heroic, legendary quality. You know, they both have that. So even though they don't necessarily

 and I, you know, I wanted her to kind of have that sort of reality to her. Besides that,
 the first time he cried. And when we saw it in Toronto, he was very emotional afterwards. I mean, I can't imagine what that's like to have sort of this story told that is a very important time

 and then it just grew from there and you know that the script is obviously what attracted all of us originally and then when we all got involved you need started to meet the cast and the cast was awesome and the producers were awesome the right
 And that didn't work out and maybe she's supposed to be like Don, maybe she's supposed to be a man, maybe she's supposed to cut herself off from being a woman.
 And I think that, you know, over the past three seasons, that was her sort of arc and in the fourth season, I really feel like she's just starting. She hasn't yet, but I really feel like she's starting to become the person that she was.
 and she's starting to become herself and not feel like she has to be something that she has seen or someone in the office or someone that she's following.
 You know, they make mistakes and they do bad things, but they're not bad people. You know, and that's very true to life and that's very true to human
 their jobs are selling happiness every day to the public.
 And you know, that, again, you know, their own struggle for their own personal happiness is very interesting. So I don't consider any of the characters bad people. They do very bad

 We filmed in Belfast, which is really cool because I've never been to Ireland. So it was really, really awesome. I really loved Ireland, honestly.
 It's such a well-respected festival. That's such a range of films from small films to bigger, you know, big blockbuster films. And I think that, you know, there's sort of a cachet and a respect that comes with the festival. So it's an honor in a way, you know, that a few festivals are, but I feel like people have a lot of respect for Toronto.
 have actually. Part of the reason is I don't remember anything. So I didn't remember what happened in the first episode till I saw it. I couldn't tell you what happens in the second one. So I'm very good for spoilers because I just don't remember what happens. I've been asked recently what my favorite episodes of the show are and we had to like go online and look at all the seasons because I couldn't remember what happened when. So I'm just bad at it. So it's not really even any, I'm not like some like expert at it, I just don't remember. So I'm good for spoilers.
 And that episode sort of surpassed, I think, what television can do or has done. You know, it sort of set a standard that I certainly cannot take soul credit for. I mean, it's a brilliant script.
 I do feel like, you know, madmen isn't even dead and buried yet.
 very much not up to me, but I don't not want to look at gift horse in the mouth. So, you know, we never know. But I think I'll pause just a second and let people enjoy madmen for
 She's come a long way, obviously. I don't think her journey is over by any means.
 A few seasons, the first three seasons were all about, especially the second season, and it was a big arc was all about her figuring out what it meant to be this woman in a man's world, and did she have to be like Don, or did she have to be a man, or did she have to play up her sexuality?
 who she is and how she can just be herself and she doesn't have to be either one, but she just be herself. I think the idea of the differences and similarities between that and now is one of the most intriguing things about the show for the audience and just playing that game of comparison. And it's definitely sparked a lot of discussions and questions, and I've been a part of the
 first start watching the show and you know there's that first funny thing I'm like oh wow my god look at that that's so different we don't
 episodes start to see things that you see here now and things that either you've experienced or seen someone do or done yourself and you start to sort of get uncomfortably similar.
 to those characters. And I think that that's what has sustained the show past. It's the original sort of gimmick of it being in that time period is that these
 And I think that's something that's become far more interesting than just it being in life.
 I realize what we what we're missing what we need though is more monsters with
 is an individual that that's a good way of putting it is like a better version a better you not necessarily changing who you are
 I was really happy with it. I mean, I was very happy with my storyline. You know, she's had a rough road as far as relationships go.
 the bad decisions and hungover mornings and I was happy that she got the most romantic scene on
 this huge theater with like thousands of people in LA. I think they like live streamed it or whatever it's called. And so we watched it with like a bunch of people. A lot of fans were there.
 show Matt was always made sure that the other actor on the other than the phone was always there. So you had to come
 and do your other side of the phone call off camera for the person. It was like a rule. That particular one was different because he was in Big Sur. So they didn't want to bring me out there, and I sort of insisted that they get me on the phone for it, because it was like our last
 like I have to be on the other end of the phone. So they actually turn the pay phone into a phone so that he could actually call me. And it was super early in the morning so I was like in bed obviously.
 And I think in my pajamas, like, with coffee and, like, my cat, like, on the...
 with John like playing Don. He's like crying and I'm like trying to get the cats to be quiet.
 So it was really heavy and then the painting was kind of awkward and kind of large and they wanted me to hold it so that you could see it in certain shots and then the cigarette is actually really
 trying to look cool, like trying not to drop the painting, trying not to bump into the walls, and then they played. They were like, what do you want to listen to? And I was like, staying alive.
 really valued it and it was really special for us because we're both like big fans of each other personally and professionally and and so we always really loved when we got to do stuff so I loved then in the last few episodes I got like some huge slattery
 the time period is so enticing and it's so beautiful to watch and there's obviously just the time period of the 60s and advertising is so enigmatic and it's
 I mean, obviously, you know, as an actor, you do bring elements of yourself to a character. That's what you have to go on. At the same time, she's very different.
 to much more, I think, naive than I am less life experience. So she's very different, but at the same time,
 It's a big question. I think that, you know, that's a question that's been asked many times over the past five years.
 But there are similarities and differences and things that have improved and things that have not improved. And obviously, we've come a long way in many ways that has been very beneficial to women. And I think that we've lost things in other ways.
 that sense of mystery about women and the way that they dress, you know, that's sort of gone.
 and lucky to play it. And then, you know, as far as how
 You know, we both try to be good people. I think that she's a relatively honest person and she tries to do the right
 And the secrets that they already know about each other are

 Yeah, absolutely. That's I mean the thing is you're in people's homes and it's funny when people come up to me I find that they'll they'll say that to me. They see

 perfect kind of moment where this pilot came along and I was in New York at the time. I was cast out of New York and everybody was buzzing about this show, Mad Men and then this other show, which
 And I said, I want to work with that man, and I met Matt. I just was like, I want to work with him.
 You could see that in his face, and you could see that in his eyes, even just in the audition.
 I loved the role and I felt like what I did with the role in that audition, what I did, who Peggy was in that audition, was the same person that he wrote. So it just felt like we really clicked.
 She's never been in the big city and now she's there
 and she's been working in a man's world for a few years and I think that for me the best way to describe her is just that journey that everybody goes
 you know, 20 to 30. She grows up and she becomes harder in a lot of ways. She gets her heart broken.
 are not, but I hope that she still retains that sense of honesty and sort of positivity and truth that I think that, you know, she's very
 she's just very much believes in whatever she's seen.
 And I think that she still has that, despite the fact that she's like, had some

 With the character and through the clothes has been, I mean, it makes my job so much easier.
 and we put it in and they played the song every time we did it and it was a very special kind of moment.
 If he'd seen us doing it like we used to just slow dance in the middle of the office for no reason just like bored, you know and Since season one and I asked Matt if he'd seen us do it and he said no, so it was a weird kind of it was just a weird coincidence and
 you know made the scripts come first nothing else it is the story that comes first and and that's why we're still here and that's why people still
 And I just find that fascinating. So I go in, I kind of make up careers or like stories to tell the Uber driver. So I totally just like lied to them. And I got in the Uber like the other day and the guy was, you know, who's talking about his kids and like his marital problems. And he's like, oh, well, you have kids, don't you? And I was like, yeah, I have two kids.
 I'm a sophomore this year, and I went my freshman year, which was really
 She comes with me on the same lady and when I'm filming and we have to do all the work and all the tests and everything and send it back the day that it's due for everyone else. Yeah, so it's like I have to just you have to keep up because then when you come home from you know your movie you if you're not if you don't keep up you're like lost
 I mean, starting out, when I was little, I had the best teachers for science, so they made me like it more. But now I'm doing chemistry this year, and then I have physics next year, which I hope I still like it after that.
 I mean I would say that I mean he always has been kind of like less celebrity crush around
 The box trolls, well, the box trolls, they're little creatures that live
 me myself doesn't really matter it's all about the way I sound so I just I had to remember that and like get used to uncomfortable that you know it doesn't matter about the emotion in your eyes you have to portray the emotion that would be in your eyes in your voice so you have to just get those layers into the way you talk which for I was like
 Wow, it was amazing because I obviously wasn't I mean I did visit Portland, Oregon where there
 like to say that I'm like in a movie with him but then maybe like just dissatisfying that like I didn't get to
 but I did get to meet him at Comic Con because when we went, so I met him then. He doesn't sound anything like sound.
 We did a session together and with Isaac we did a session together, which was nice because you know it was also kind of like you want other actors there
 We did, when we did the scene about talking about the fathers, me and Isaac did that, because that's kind of more like an emotional, not an action.
 you have to see the box trolls because it's extremely clever and it's unlike anything you've seen before.
 Well obviously these little guys are definitely judged by kind of their name and the way they look
 They're very scared and in order for them to show people who they truly are, they have to overcome their fear and they have to stop being terrified.
 is an orphan in a way so he he's trying to figure out you know what what is the family you know what what is it supposed to be and yeah we have a good talk about kind of that you know father's always supposed to be there for you no matter what
 also in a fish who is one of the box trolls is like eggs father even though you know he doesn't really fit you wouldn't think of him as a father because he's a little box troll
 really fit the norm, but he treats eggs like a fatherly figure. So even though they're not related, he still treats him that way.
 Well, it's all handmade so when you watch it and I feel like you can
 you can see the heart and you can just tell that like fingers molded all of this and it's
 It's something, I mean, you don't, you obviously don't see them doing it, but it, you can tell, you know, it sets it apart, then it's just, it's not just our computer, it's made from
 Without reading the script or anything, I went in and I met with Rob, Linda and Joe.
 And from that first meeting, they told me about the story.
 a Disney princess and from that meeting we just got along so well and they were so nice.
 then they gave me the script after that meeting and I went home and read it right away.
 It's the classic story of you know sleeping beauty plus so much more information so you get to
 You get to know why things happen and why, you know, Maleficent becomes so evil and sort of the steps that it takes. Because, you know, people aren't just evil just because, you know, there has to be a cause. And in our film, you get to see sort of what that cause is.
 sort of bring the essence of her and I know like when you see pictures of her sort of the way she stands with her hands and I was just sort of taking it all in before the mood before we started filming this movie I watched the anime
 movie again just to sort of see if I could pick up on any little mannerisms that she did.
 sort of in the forest and sort of brought those little princess elements but you know also wanting to make
 You know, have those elements, but also make her a real person, not just an animated character.
 the pixies and they're my ants as well. And when you get to see them
 big they're tiny and then when they become you know the human form when they have to take care of baby Aurora you know they grow
 They have to be like peasant women, which I don't think they enjoy very much. They like their wings and their funny costumes.
 with the horns and the intensity and all that and we definitely have that.
 Maleficent's bird, sort of her pet bird, and she gets, in our film, we get to see him as a man as well because she turns
 turns into a man, and when I meet, and when I'm little, I play with the bird. I do see the bird. I pet, you know, and I have a pretty bird is what I call him. And then when I get older, I get to see a man.
 to see his character from when he's young and sort of, it's a journey for him as much as it is for Maleficent in a way. So you get to sort of see why he becomes so evil and why she becomes so evil.
 that Christy seems after that, Melissa sort of follows a roar around while a roar is growing up. So you get to see me sort of in different stages is, you know, young, a toddler and then sort of eight years old and then you finally see me sort of as a teenager. And Melissa is sort of there hiding away in every step of this
 This is different and and I and I like I like
 And so once you hear that, I'm like, oh, I hope I get to do that. And then he wanted to meet with me.
 the story of it and what it really was about, about these beauty obsessed women, and I was so all in.
 Well, the way that Nick works was very different from how I had worked before. It was extremely close and we were going off instincts the whole time. We would change things along the way. And he allowed me, I never felt this much freedom on a set. He kind of, he allowed me to put my
 Views or even as being a teenager myself. I was 16 my character was 16 so there'd be a lot of things where I'd be like Nick she would never Say this or you know she would never wear this
 freedom. It was it was a strange but amazing feeling to work that way.
 Say this or you know she would never wear this and he's like, okay, we will change it will change so yeah, I never felt that freedom it was It was a strange but amazing feeling to work that way and we filmed in sequence in chronological order so that was very helpful because she does you know
 I related, kind of, one thing was that she's, you know, she's from a small town and moves to a big city. And we made her from Georgia, which is where I'm from, and moved to LA.
 Seeing a big city and in fresh eyes and and also being the youngest person around because I mean I started acting
 when I was young so I know how it feels to be kind
 the pronouns that he and you know so we wanted to talk about that but it's nice that our film I think our films unique in that way where it's they've been living with him for a very long time now but then it's
 Starts where, boom, you want to take the next step and get the testosterone.
 You know, I I'm not playing a female so that was interesting to feel a lot of female energy, but I wasn't contributing to that
 We will we get the senior patio, which is a huge deal because if you're not a senior you're not allowed to be on it as an underclassman. So now we can like kick off all the freshmen and kick off all the cheers.

 I was getting accepted into the Lyca family. So that was nice. She has her core line doll and now I have my Winnie. So it's very cool. But I was really familiar with their stop motion and, you know, in their movies because I felt like I grew up with it kind of because my sister for like seven or eight years, she was voicing core line. And I did get to go to Portland and visit the studios with her.
 in their world. So I knew I was familiar with it. I think they kind of they asked me to do this because they already knew
 Yeah, it's so I love the the the teenage like the girl in it Yeah, and I did get to see where I went to the box trolls When I went to there I went up to Portland and saw the set there and I saw pair of Norman like some of their dolls they have sitting out and the girl is just so funny She has her fingernails or painted pink and she has like a pink tracksuit that's tiny. I'm like and it's real Terry
 I feel like I've never played someone like her before because she definitely is kind of a brat.
 You know like she's she's not someone that you you kind of want to dislike her, but then you don't
 feel you know it's similar because I still prepare in the same way as I still imagine that I'm this person
 and work with the script and feel like I'm still becoming a character, but then it's very different because you don't have your face to rely on. You don't have your eyes to kind of show that emotion and all the layers have to be depicted in the way you sound, which at first was definitely a challenge for me, because I felt like I was really acting with my face. You don't have to do that.
 Just make sure that it it comes out in your voice portrays the emotion so then you get more comfortable with it, but that was that
 I like to play that game when I watch animated films trying to guess the celebrity. I think we're going to stump a lot of people with this one.
 Just seeing how small these things are and realizing that every single thing you see on screen is handmade by the oddest materials and they're all have all these mechanics underneath them.
 can snarl and like everything and everything
 is done by a human touch and you can really tell that there's a lot of heart that goes into it. I think like five seconds takes two weeks to do.
 they do movies that they're not just like, oh, for, you know, funny for kids, like, whatever they like have, like, meaning to them. And they're also, they're very
 I did My Neighbor Totoro with, maybe I was younger, but I did My Neighbor Totoro with my sister.
 And that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that long because it was like as first stop motion that they had done
 What they did so then later when like just a couple years ago and they asked me to do box trolls. I was
 and I like when new creatures are introduced.
 today, I would with my sister, I guess I was kind of trying to get attention, but it never worked because I did it every single year, but I would like pretend that I fell
 completely. I was in shock because I loved all houses when I went I was very young.
 And it was just like miniatures everywhere.
 blew my mind that there were people out there that did this.
 Yes, because I knew everyone and I was just, I loved the boxroll script and I loved when
 she's kind of like an unexpected maybe character for me to play just because I don't know I've ever played anyone like her before she has like this kind of bratty element and she's like slightly spoiled but I liked how
 but then on the inside she's like loves all these little grotesque things
 and that was fun to just be kind of dramatic.
 First, when the audience sees where they might not like her so much, she's a little snooty. But afterwards, she wins you over and you realize what she is and she has a sensitive side and she's just trying to help eggs and get the attention from her dad that she wants.
 Make sure that it's right also I mean with being with other English actors in the film
 okay job so I mean I did have a dialect coach that was with me and she was on set or I guess
 But with me in there and she would, you know, perfect little words and get it right. And we wanted to make, I think that Winnie's was a little more pusher than I'd ever done. Because, you know, she's high elite of the cheese bridge.
 I think so, whenever it happens, I don't know when we're going to film it.
 Yeah, I want I've never read it before so I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do all the research that I need to do
 such a close bond. I've never really had that with the director being so collaborative. It was like I would show up in the mornings and
 and that was just extraordinary to have and his style and all of his choices and you know the shots it was just so specific and everything meant something was so detailed and was like doing a so artistic like a photograph.
 So mixing that with, you know, the fashion world and these women is just an extraordinary thing. I think the film, you know, having all those very complex themes, it's amazing.
 It's all with girls so and it's not I feel like a lot
 Crazy. So people are just looking at this false image that's not perfect. So then they see a real human being. They're like, oh, you're not perfect. It looks like what you're looking
 I'm not, I'm not, but yeah, she's five four and I'm about five, six and a half, five

 They're completely different because mine was in the 60s and then hers was more modern in a different area.

 The dialogue was Sally didn't want Sandra on set because she wanted to think more about the scenes and the characters and have the dialects sort of be already there. And you know, one less thing to worry about, which it was nice to have it sort of
 I think it was so exciting to see so many different types of people in one film.

 do we need where is my character going and it kind of just went relied on instincts and the mornings I would show up and he'd be like so what are you what are you feeling today like what do you want to do and I'm like God like
 He made her to come from like a small town, go to a big city, which is what I
 looks skinnier or it's like crazy so people are just looking at this false image that's not perfect then they see a real human being they're like oh you're not perfect it's like what you're looking at is fake so it's kind
 been is Ben Affleck's gonna you know that here's a script that he's gonna direct and that he wrote your cut and he's gonna star in you're like all right yes like whatever
 Great, but I, of course, I've read the script and really, the way that it's written
 the action sequence kind of playing out. It's really so many different things going on in time periods. And obviously, Loretta, she really, you know, stuck out to me. And after reading, I really was like, I hope I get the part.
 So I had to meet with Ben, but yeah, it was really great.
 So well and how to kind of create the best environment to
 facilitate your best performance and to me and to want to just let everyone be creative and
 and he's just so kind of giving in that way. And then as a director, I can't believe his organization and his mind, you know, to have to switch and switch, but when you're
 He is my first day on set. My first scene was the scene with...
 And it was like, it's a very intense scene after I've, like, come back from Hollywood.
 Because I think for a while she didn't really get to face her demons like she should have because she was very
 busy kind of up in the clouds saying these words that she kind of I think believed in the beginning but started to start to trail off and so she didn't really get to face all those like she should have. Maybe it would have worked out better.
 There's a woman, Amy Simple McPherson, which we based a lot of kind of Loretta's look off of her, her white and the big, jeweled crosses and things. And there was YouTube videos that I had watched actually. I was like, this amazing video of her.
 the movie is sort of the lonely more doesn't really have anything to do in his life and then Cleo sort of comes in and she
 You know, taking care of him. She's making him breakfast and things like that. She's being like the mom to him in a way. But yeah, she's just a normal 11-year-old girl. I was 11 when I shot in. So I can relate to her a lot.
 We played Rock Band a lot with Steven because we did a lot of rehearsals.

 But both of us really had to be like, we play it all the time. So we sort of taught us how to do the whole thing. And yeah, we were jealous of him because he was so kind.
 ice skating. It helps with the balance and posture, but I fell a lot when I was training. I trained for about
 like a huge deal now and it got so big it was sort of not even
 I was too. It's funny because when we were filming it, it was all green screen and there wasn't trains flying above you. It wasn't like that. Also, seeing it for the first time with everything put together, it was crazy. I was screaming. I couldn't believe it looked like that.
 It was exactly like it was on screen really. We had the best time together and we laughed so much. All of them were so cool. I was the youngest one, I was 12.
 that that's what he used to film with when he was a kid with all his friends.
 we try to perfect it so I wouldn't be you know when we started filming that was just already there so I wouldn't be thinking about that because the audience can definitely tell that you're you know thinking about that one
 you indicated she we did our actions were different because mine was in the 60s and hers is more modern
 each other tips but hers was I thought was impeccable she had such a good
 I did a little bit, but I also, I, Sally grew up in that time. So, from that, I sort of picked her brain about what it was like and sort of growing up in the time of how it was so scary.
 Then the original animated version, Sleeping Beauty, and that one, Rosh, is very
 Yeah, everything that you think of Princess is in kind of all those characteristics she definitely has.
 But in ours she still is that way and she loves everyone and it's very open and she's not afraid
 and she's like, everyone's normally so scared of me, but Aurora, she knows she hasn't learned.
 She hasn't learned to be scared of things that look odd or, you know, creatures that have horns. And it's nice for Aurora, and this one she has more depth. And obviously, there are a lot of secrets that are kept from her. You know, she thinks both of her parents are dead, and she lives kind of very isolated in this cottage with her three fairy aunties. And so she doesn't really know much about, you know, outside of the forest.
 And it's nice that I could bring, you know, more layers to her and have more strength than just kind of the pretty, pretty princess.

 And I kind of had one. Well, last year, the boy who asked me, he was a junior.

 We haven't started yet. I mean we're just beginning to talk about casting. I was offered the part
 And then as I was reading it, I started envisioning scenes, and then I told the writer and the producer about the scenes I was envisioning, and they liked it, and then I said, well, why don't I direct it?
 a filming artist doesn't live here anymore and the actress is opened in Tucson. So it was around my birthday. So I threw a party for the cast and crew of Alice
 and I got up and followed her and she got to the top of the wrap of the aisle and she fainted and I went over to help her and I loosened
 And I remember one morning I left town.
 The first one. I left town because I was so excited about it. I thought I really must calm down. So I made myself take a drive and not listen.
 When I got home, I had a bouquet of flowers all over my doorstep, so I knew I was...
 Most of the times that I was nominated, I was working in between.
 but it's hard not to, it kind of takes over your mind.
 Well, I wasn't there. I was on Broadway and same time next year.
 Well, they would let me off. But I didn't think it was fair because the people waited so long and they got tickets sometimes through for months ahead of time.
 It was fun. We were shooting in Pittsburgh and I like Pittsburgh very much.
 wonderful person to work with. And the rest of the cast, too, I love my daughter, Julianne Moore, she said. I think new, exciting, beautiful.
 know it's a movie about relationships and there aren't too many of those around
 I'm glad to see that it got made and I hope
 I still get letters. It wasn't the most successful movie I did, but I still get letters.
 use it in their workshops and on healing and on dying. And a lot of people had told me that they were with their parents when they died because of having seen the movie. And I think it's changed people's attitude that people have been exposed to it. A lot about death.
 And I used to play always good mothers, lately I've been playing bad mothers.
 You know, there are a lot of really wonderful actresses who are
 Because they're at the rules for them. So I don't think there's a lack of
 You know, it's not just that they're not running the parts, I think it's a reflection of our culture.
 When I made Dallas doesn't live here anymore in 1974, there weren't any films being made from a woman's point of view. It was a kind of watershed picture and I think that's changed over
 Actresses have taken it upon themselves to make their own work.
 When you work in a film where you don't have much to do, that's when you don't really know what to do with yourself. When you have a story where there's a lot happening and there's a lot to work on, that's when it becomes very challenging.
 We're all sworn to secrecy. We can't talk about it. It's a space travel. I think I can say that. Sci-fi is big.
 Yeah, that is wonderful. There are a lot of actors.
 I think so. I haven't seen it, but I saw Matthew McConaughey at the Emmys. I said am I still in the film because I had such a small party could be cut. He said, you're in it. I've seen it. It's great.
 I think I've been very good about getting my goals in mind what I want
 But I don't think I've ever been called on to really sacrifice.
 here so I get to come and visit her. My brother used to live nearby so I came
 to see him. So I feel very at home here. And then I hear that it's the oldest film festival. I didn't know that in the world.
 I had no idea that it was as popular as it is. I mean, only since it this season opened last week, have I been getting reactions, like I've never gotten for anything I've ever done in my career? I mean, I can't walk my dog without
 It's a hugely popular show and the people.
 No, I did to don't now be one season.
 because I have to watch so many shows for voting. But I did watch, if you have these shows, and liked it very much. But I had no idea that it was what it is to people, which is a stop.
 Now, though, I have a script called Baving Flow that I just love, and I want to act in it and direct. That's a new challenge I'm looking forward to. And, you know, we're in the process of raising money, which is the hardest thing I've ever done.
 that she felt inside that she needed to express, to test herself.
 The priests who were working in the film were very active on the set, blessing the set and us.
 and they're both really wonderful films and my television series will be aired
 that's life and I'm just having the best time I've ever had my career. I work every day and having a steady job.
 It's nice to come back to television with such good writing and good
 an experience on its own. We saw the film for the first time in its entirety
 Their fans of Scott Pilgrim and that just was so overwhelming that we got to sit there together as a cast and kind of experience it for the first time in that environment, you know, because you're there with people who are really passionate about the project and the
 They wanted it to be good and they were and it was the reception was amazing. They loved it. They laughed at all the right parts.
 It got support were both comfortable with our weapons and I think that was most important is that we were we didn't feel like we were holding foreign objects in our hands and
 was really important and key to us being able to sort of deliver the choreographer
 and that with the help of the amazing stunt team, we just, I hope
 Yeah, I would she's campaign because you know, I think it's really cool that she's a girl drummer and she's just kind of sitting there. She observes everything and she's just
 And I think that's just cool because, you know, I guess it's sort of in a way opposite of knives.
 because she's just so involved with everything and Kim is sort of, she sits back and kind of just takes it in.
 Yeah, well, I mean, even right going right into shooting Brian had an
 This fifth look, yeah. And he was still, you know, going through that.
 and then I think it was during production we got to read that and then the six book just
 It got support. We were both comfortable with our weapons and I think that was most important is that we were we didn't feel like we were holding foreign objects in our hands and
 It reminds me a lot about the sort of John Hughes films in a way that the sort of ensemble cast coming of age story and I think that's what's really great about Scott
 about being able to play knives is that we can just sort of let loose and allow myself to purely and
 You know, like it to show that's fun, but it's also

 and we're not trying to be sexy in the city, but again we do have a lot of the
 a lot of them worked also on the sex and the city. So we do have the support of that and them putting in their input too.
 It's been a blast just working on the show. It's essentially a prequel to Sex and the City. All the same creators on board. Kenneth Bushnell wrote the book and now it's a TV show and we're really excited about it. It's essentially Carrie Bradshaw in her formative years.
 the mouse and I asked Candice Bushnell that and she was just very nonchalant about it. It was just one of those things that kind of stuck she had a friend and they kind of started calling her mouse for some reason. And so I think it's sort of the same thing. I mean with with with mouse into the carry diaries, she's got this sort of way of kind of figuring things out. Like she plans everything out and she like gathers information
 of a mouse in a way so and plus she gets to wear all these really fun mouse pins on all of her outfits so she has a different mouse pin for every outfit so that's also a reason why that she has that nickname but she's also carries loyal supportive friend and she's pragmatic and also she's got her life sort of planned out
 realizes along the way that that's not exactly the best way to live your life.

 sex in the city left such a legacy you know and I hope that we can bring on the same fans but also Norish and develop new fans for this show because it's also geared towards a younger demographic but it's also taking a great character a woman who was just so confident and unique and okay and had a great sense of self and was
 majored in film and television and kind of were the business side of it.
 And then after I finished school, that's when I was like, okay, now is my time to really kind of.
 and put it on screen, how do you share it with the world? And that, to me, was always fascinating. So after I finished school, I finished university, I decided to just actually quit all my jobs. And my parents are always crazy because I had a job offer to after school, and I was like, no, I'm not going to do it. They're like, what?
 you know, like they just couldn't fathom the fact that I didn't want to be working, but I was like, but I am working. I am auditioning.
 So, I mean, I think it's kind of hard for people to...
 I asked them to understand it first, but I mean, for me, it was something I really needed to
 harassment, understand it first, but I mean, for me, it was something I really needed to pursue.
 She just called me up and said there's a really great role you should go out for. So I put myself on tape at first. I didn't have too much time to kind of check
 what Pratcho and Ponderiti cry out in Thailand at Barham, what they kind of put out there. It's just amazing.
 It's a film but at the same time I think it's a piece of art because there's so much coming at you visually.
 You know sort of this uninhibited girl like she's just so much fun and full of energy and and she's just got this genuine love of life And so that was what initially attracted me to her and then after I remember because that's how I when I first auditioned for her For the role that's kind of this side of knives that I had to show and then when I looked at
 I just thought you know wow she's really cool because she's got so many sides to her and you get to really sort of see her growth and and so I thought that was really
 I remember shooting that time when we were shooting that scene too was fun because we got to sort of do the concert scene.
 And we couldn't help but keep laughing. So I just remember like it took us so long.
 I think it was really important for all of us to to have read the series before getting into the shooting part of it because we we tried to stay so you know true to Ryan Leo
 just about had his own Caribbean islands? Not once, but three times. Three times! Members of Parliament proposed Anna
 her first time going through it, you know what I mean? So you're getting the purest, most uninhibited feelings ever being shown to you. And I think that's what makes her different.
 and you'd like, he'd like, take me and be like, to get master it. So by the time you get here, I wanted the first one.
 Yeah, oh absolutely, you know, I've been I've been writing some scripts for the past couple of years and
 You know the movie I kind of want to make I wrote this script called Shaq and it's just like this movie takes place in one location and I just thought it would be fun to make for like no money with some friends You know get him you get to make a movie before you make a movie in a
 sense. You know, you can make something on a super, super low budget small camera with your
 I just remember really being struck by the sense of adventure and like morning
 you're in and you're like I didn't really feel like I got to know that period that well. But one of the joys about working with Ang Lee is that his beautiful mind and his kind of obsession with every little facet of the detail of the period really rubs off on to everyone else and you really find yourself learning a lot more about the
 than you ever thought you would. And that was something that happened with me and I found myself really, you know, consuming
 material that he would give me you know a lot of the different DVD and he sent me probably
 that Heath Ledger had and broke back Mountain that I really liked and that was a performance that I was also directed. There were some of that, you know, the Billy's not a gay character, but there was something about the kind of internal conflict
 the deer hunter where I was like oh that's a great moment that maybe Billy could have
 It's the sound of the gun that puts you in that state. It's hard to think that without actually knowing what it sounds like.
 seems to kind of have that snap quick awareness reaction because before I remember I tried it in rehearsal before I go
 those little subtleties that maybe a lot of the people in the audience when they watch if there's if it's not there they won't consciously know but what Ang is so he's part of his genius is filling in all
 question marks to where when people watch it, it just has this feeling of kind of honesty and perfection and truth.
 to success with their work, it just shows a discipline and a passion and a rigor that is only beneficial in my opinion.
 If not more a conversation, just about what kind of shoes Billy should wear.
 You know, that's just an example of the kinds of details that we would talk about. You know, and we would have hours just talking about what kind of, what kind of person Billy was. We would create whole stories in our minds about who Billy was and what had happened to him and why he feels a certain way.
 I just I loved it. I mean because I I'm very similar in the sense that I love to obsess about my character when I work on
 process when it was actually really, really spare. I think kind of, Paul and I were both really prepared and ready to go, but I think
 We knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes, but they still had like a fresh just kind of just out of
 exactly the tone of the scenes because you want to capture that naturalism where people watch and they're like oh I believe these characters I believe these are real people I like these guys but at the same time you know you want to be
 and stuff like that. And sometimes there's moments where it goes against being a hundred percent.
 an exciting kind of thriller experience, you know, with like sci-fi action and
 just the setting of Moscow and this kind of different visual language with the 3D that people haven't normally seen and I think it's going to also be pretty scary you know I think hopefully
 you know, the best elements of JAWS and that kind of, where is this creature, where is this thing? I hope we can bring some of that to the screen and I think that that'll all make up for a pretty good time.
 they told me that Olivia was already attached and that was definitely a really big
 influence on me wanting to do the film. I really liked a lot of her performances and I thought she was just a
 I'd seen her in a couple, I'd seen her in a play with Chris Pine and a really good play.
 North and I really liked your performance there and I liked your Juno.
 I just thought it would be pretty fun to work with an actor who's never really made a movie like this.
 in that way. And she's been having a really interesting time and just kind of adapting to this.
 I don't know why it works, but I know when I feel like it's not working.
 film and the opportunity to get to work with him and he's made so many classic films over the years and
 He's just not only a great director, but he's just a hilarious, wonderfully
 I don't think I've ever played a character that was probably as amoral in a certain sense.
 but at the same time, it sounds really dark, but there's also, you know, this dark humor to it.
 I think that everybody's got, you know, their light sides and their dark sides and their good days and their bad days. So, you know, it's kind of examining the text.
 you know, version of it. And studying that part, you know, there's so much of that moral ambiguity and the kind of, you know, he's so conflicted about whether or not to
 people and who does he love and who does not love and I think that that really helped me when it came
 You know, a lot of the guys I grew up with, you know, I lived in Topanga, California.
 which is kind of kind of a rural community. And you know, there was times where I remember, you know,
 Once you are kind of, you know, in that environment for long enough, you know, the trailer becomes its own
 There is a lot of nuance to it, and there is the highs.
 I had worked with, um, uh, on Into the Wild, and the character I portrayed in the film, Chris McAlice, had donated his life savings before he went on this kind of exodus that he did, uh, to Oxfam America, the Oxford Famine Relief. It's a humanitarian aid organization. And they had asked me when the film came out, if I'd be interested in going
 to a part of the world. In this case, it was the Democratic Republic of Congo. And they show you the programs that they have, you know, with, you know, the water, you know, clean water and
 wells and food distribution and support for rape victims and some of the rape clinics that they have out there. And then you come back and hopefully you can spread the word about what they do and they really do a lot of really
 the freedoms they have, the luxuries they have, everything you have that you take for granted, take tap water for granted. I was staying in one of the nicest hotels in the Congo and it barely had running water when I was there. And then we went to another part and I talked to a guy who was

 My name is Emil Hirsch and I was just told that I'm going to be given the opportunity to play Speed Racer and Larry and Andy Wachowski's new movie Speed Racer, going to be produced by Joel Silver and just super excited ever since I was a kid I wanted to be in a movie like this with guys like Larry and Andy who made the Matrix
 racing you know in America everybody has a car so everybody can kind of be speed in a weird way you know one of the one of the dangerous parts about the audition process for me was I'd get into the character of speed and I'd like start thinking about it and I'd be like driving home after the audition like

 It was like the most amazing actor you could ever be around. I mean, you're just so riveted by his every movement.
 You know, I felt that I wanted to kind of get mechanics. I wanted to be true to who he was as a person. I didn't want to just throw the character out the window and do my own interpretation or anything.
 kind of touches upon as something that exists within us all, you know, that yearning quest for adventure.
 into the wild was such a long, hard shoot that I think I just went into speed racer with a lot

 and it was very complicated psychologically you know I was trying to let on but not too much
 of my favorite scenes it ended up being that way but I remember there was like one of the first takes and they were like action and I just like
 that it gets people a lot more self-conscious about the

 It's an incredible story and a great monument to men and women in uniform and people who serve and people who are willing to make those sacrifices. And they should be appreciated. They shouldn't get lost. And it's a 24-7 news cycle that we have these days where it's like you hear about something about on the news. And two days later, it's not even in your mind.
 This is a chance to really appreciate a really special group of people that have made some huge sacrifices for

 A group of people he wanted to like the movie. He told me that before we even shot. He said that's what all that matters is.
 You know, I tried to just learn as much as I could about him, you know, through the family. I got to meet with Walton, Billy McAnlis, Chris, his parents.
 You know, try to read a lot of the philosophy that Chris was reading at the time. You know, there's Walden by
 and you know essays and poems by Ralph Waldo Emerson. So there was that kind of philosophical background and the call of the wild by Jack London was really

 Um, well, you know, I just, I just tried to plan for who I thought he was. And, you know, if people feel that way, they're more than entitled and welcome to feel that way. You know, there's nothing wrong with feeling like that. I don't think that's just a perspective on him.
 No, I don't I don't feel like I short-changed or you know gave me canless a phone book to phone book to sit under

 I think that sometimes some of these smaller movies where they don't have enough money to have a big action sequences or necessarily a lot of plot or a lot of locations.
 So that's that's always a benefit for the actors because you get more more more stuff to play and
 benefits to the audience I guess that just depends on what the audience is looking for you know if you're if you want to have a couple of laughs and a really enjoyable time and see if

 I haven't been done the emitories for a long time now, but it's just so nice to see it continuing and watching it. I can now be a fan.
 Oh, I love it. Yeah, I love the film. I love the first film and I think

 change the history of comedy with David Brent. He created a whole new kind of genre and a whole new mannerisms and ways that people speak to each other, which I find fascinating. He changed the history of time. There goes David Brent. I must remember to thank
 because there's something so endearing about it. I think the thing about great comedy is that it's got to have a real heart to it and I think when somebody makes that much of a fool of themselves and but they think they're smashing it that's the thing they think they're nailing it and they think that everyone likes they think they're really cool and actually behind their backs people are
 So I think, yeah, I think it's quite endearing and I think people like that. I think that's what makes him so likable, even though he's a letchy old fart that gets everything wrong. I think people really, you really root for him because it is endearing and he's just trying to be pals with everyone. He's trying really hard and there's no malice in it. He's just trying really hard and I think that's what people like.
 I've got a few things I'm filming the Tracy Almond sketch show at the moment, which has been really fun. I've just got back from the Cotswild's filming Father Brown as well. And I've got some films coming out that I should be promoting very soon. So yeah, it's all good. I've worked a lot this year. I've been really lucky this year.
 Oh God, he was amazing. I was a bit disappointed. I didn't actually have any scenes with him, but I met him on set and he was great. I've been so lucky. The last few jobs I've had, I've worked with some absolute legends. My next goal is Ricky Gervais, so hoping to kind of near him in tonight.

 Yeah, well, I play Lydia, who is Kyle's fiance, and he goes on his stagdo.
 she's trying to get intimate with him and he's just not having any of it because he doesn't want her to know obviously that he's contracted an STD. So it shows all the hilarious things he has to do to kind of distract her from wanting to have
 Yeah, and he has to retrace the steps and find out where this STD came from. So, yeah, no, I just, I read this script. I thought it was really funny. It's an original idea. I don't think I've ever heard of a film doing something like that. So, yeah, and I just, I really love the part and I like, I love the relationship with Lydia and Kyle. I think it's sweet. And it's actually quite sad watching the breakdown of their relationship, because I think there was a lot there in the beginning.
 Well, I don't think in any other kind of wedding
 involved this particular subject of catching an STD. You know, you think there's going to be, in all these kind of romcoms, you think it's going to be a happy ending, they're going to get married and it's all going to be lovely. But, you know, when you watch this film to our knowledge, this guy is cheated on his fiancé, it's kind of like, you know, it's a bit dark, really. So you kind of wonder if there really is going to be a happy ending. I think with other films, you kind of know there's going to be a happy ending and it's all going to be lovely. But with this one, you just

 Possibly what's going on next. Yeah, quite a few stuff. So if I'm not really out to talk about actresses always say
 yourself tape so it's hilarious because you have to just kind of do it so quickly get it done in your bedroom as quickly as possible so you have to get rid of all your clothes at a
 We've just done a film with Misha Barton in New York. Yeah, we filmed partly in London and partly in New York, so that was really good. I really enjoyed it, so that would be out I think maybe in a year's time films take forever.
 So, you know, actually happened. See, yeah, that was great. I've got another film coming out called I Beether Undead, which is
 Mae'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd
 Yeah, well in the horde I play Molly. She's Misha's friend. Misha plays the girl called Ella and I really love playing that character because she's very ballsy and she's a really fun character, quite playful, you know, quite tongue-in-cheek in moments. So yeah, she was really fun to play. Nice costume too.
 Mae'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd i'n mynd
 changed the history of comedy with David Brent. He created a whole new kind of genre and a whole new mannerisms and ways that people speak to each other, which I find fascinating. He changed the history of time. There goes David Brent. I must remember to thank
 because there's something so endearing about it. I think the thing about great comedy is that it's got to have a real heart to it and I think when somebody makes that much of a fool of themselves and but they think they're smashing it that's the thing they think they're nailing it and they think that everyone likes they think they're really cool and actually behind their backs people are
 So I think, yeah, I think it's quite endearing and I think people like that. I think that's what makes him so likable, even though he's a letchy old fart that gets everything wrong. I think people really, you really root for him because it is endearing and he's just trying to be pals with everyone. He's trying really hard and there's no malice in it. He's just trying really hard and I think that's what people like.
 When you're dealing in a trauma center late at night, you're going to get everything right, because you're going to get all gunshot victims, you're going to get people who've been in high-intense accidents. And a lot of that stuff happens at night time, right?
 i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w

 so it's hard to wear underwear in an ER. I mean those those those pajama type clothes may it's difficult because you got the underwear
 drama film I feature myself and Tom Hopper as two brothers
 It's a drama drawn from a section of John Steinmeck's
 Because it is a quite a sprawling plot that an awful lot happens and things just start to occur and I don't want to give away too much it's have to trust me that it's a
 various rewards in terms of copies of the scripts. You get to come to the screening.
 come and actually be in the film itself because we need extras and certain scenes. We've got scenes of myself and Tom Hopper and if you guys want to come along they'll be great.
 Because it is, it is where most movie takes place and it becomes this kind of vision.
 dark nuances of this psychological aspect of peoples.
 there's a lot of character in it and it's just really, really scary. And when I read it, I was like, this is, this is kind of messed up. And then when you read it and it's messed up, then it's going to be even better when you actually see it.
 for studs. And he said, can I buy your football boots? And I said, why? And he goes, I need a front edition. I was like, well, you can't play football. And he said, no, I can't. It's OK. You can buy boots if I can come. And he goes, OK, fine. So I came along the edition and Paul gave me the part. And then I was doing my finals in college, well, I was on studs for eight weeks, with Brendan Gleese and David Wilmer. So I was running my thesis
 The very start, I almost took Baddie's head off and came out with a lot of bruise knuckles and he had to kind of take me down and go, you don't actually have to kill me. I was like, no, no, this is fun because you kind of feel like you're getting into a proper fight and then you realize
 at very annoyed at each other because I felt that he was messing up and he thought that I was messing up and we ended up getting really into it and almost killed each other for a half an hour or literally doing this fight was very serious.
 I'm not sure. I was cinematographer in a film called Charlie Casanova, which is going to be released in January and February, which
 I actually just love everything to do it and to do it film.
 of as much control about it. It's a different, it's a different way of working, but at the same time it's all the same thing.
 Yeah, I mean, that's a very good example. I think, I think it's because you get experience being on set and being with people and kind of getting
 thing and then you get to kind of you're more aware of how to tell a story I think if you're working
 You're more aware of how to tell a story, I think, if you're working as an actor and you see it from a different perspective.
 I have no idea. I think I joined drama because it was love to
 actually did the soundtrack for the first film. I directed Christian Blake which is released and she did the soundtrack for that. I knew and I did a lot of music for I did a documentary for T.
 and they come from Germany, Australia and Austria just to come down and actually watch your film. And I'm shooting this scene, this is Magnificent Castle and it's kind of like being in a fairy tale. And you're sitting there in France and this is great, kind of an holiday. And then there's about two or three of the people
 and holiday. And then there's about two or three of the people standing there just watching you do your scene.
 really nice it's almost like doing theater in a way and you're doing this scene and you know and then they're all watching they're all really sweet and it's kind of
 I think what they do is have a really interesting take on the whole Arthurian tales and the Camelot era and that kind of thing and they've done a lot of that kind of stuff today
 few of those things before. I think they do a lot, does that have fun with it?
 Jameson, it's the Jameson Empire 62nd Competition, which myself and Jim Sheldon, which is wonderful, are judging, and he did it last year. And I did a couple of years ago.
 you can just go and which are made to make it really interesting at the thing and someone like Jim was going to see it and a friend of mine did it last year and a girl acted in one of the pieces it didn't win but Jim actually saw her and then wanted to meet her just
 i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w i'w
 in New Mexico and that's getting released in the cinema in January and February. We just found out yesterday.
 You know it's actually awesome because everyone's really really cool and some really cool people and I got to meet the guys who've made Rack
 these homeless guys who attack this group of women and these group of girls and then this supernatural creature occurs at the highest, the crescendo of the violence from man to man, then the negative energy basically brings in a creature which has
 Because, you know, it was because you got to look at, from an acting point of view, seeing where it went with these different people, the homeless guys and the girls, but also because I wanted to explore where
 some supernatural creature will come from and whether it draws a disparity between a good person, a bad person, whether like a ghost or a creature will just kill everybody. And I was like, where did that come from? I think it should come from negative energy.
 When I best my team's brilliant, he's brilliant there. As Brian Fortune, he's not a very good friend of mine. All three of us have worked together quite a few.
 I've got like five or six.
 I don't need to choose my own film as an example. What we try to do is a bit of drama and relationship.
 I don't need to use my own film as an example. What we try to do is a bit of drama and relationships and so on.
 There's an awful lot of times you see a breakdown of someone's team of relationship and then something horrific happens and brings people together how they deal with a situation struggle and you can. A drama doesn't really get that across all the time and the horror actually allows to see people in these extreme circumstances and sees what people react to what they'll do.
 the biggest influence I made. And also Rosemary's baby is a very clever film because that also looks at society and looks at the drama of the people and relationships. It's not just about a horror film, it's an awful lot more
 I think I'd like to make my films that way and I think it's important that you can make entertainment and also try and have something through it, even if it's very subtle that someone takes them from.
 I think it's important sometimes to explore negative aspects of society and people's psyche.
 I'll put a number for a counselling on my website and then if you want to go to that person then give it to me.
 I was really excited because I thought the Paula created the character that it was really interesting to me and it was quite dark and quite layered. And then I went, oh God, Resident Evil, I really want to do that.
 I think what Paul does really cleverly is, he understands the games in a way where that's why he's able to create the world so well. But he's done things sometimes, he's created characters himself to fit for how he wants the movies to go, which is what he did with Alice and what he did with my character.
 some moments to some moments when you're kind of like you know going down some corridors and you kind of go and I remember this and then something is jumping out at you're like getting a little bit of PTSD flashbacks from being 15 years old and in my
 time a lot we shot in in the rain and in the darkness we had two or three hundred eggs
 There's a lot of coyotes. I think it's great stunt guy Nathan Barris. He did a great job. But at the same time, when everything is suddenly coming at you, you're kind of a little bit like, oh my God, it's happening. So there's moments when everything's, there's these big fences and all the zombies are trying to get through and you have a vague idea of where your marks are supposed to be. But at the same time, it's instinctual to just figure out.
 That way we had one or two foam things only because when you're doing stuff where you're jumping off
 and stuff are kind of rolling around, you get the foam one, but that was more than that you don't break the prop, not about you.
 I don't look stupid. I just wanted to keep filming stuff whenever he called cut. I just wanted to film everything is going on
 like having a coffee and just talking about the weather and stuff. Yeah, that's it. You know, the atmosphere they create on set, Meal and Paul have a great energy about them and they just make it real.
 consoles, they used to have all the old Nintendo and Xbox and SNES and then come the R64 and all sorts of other playing games and I used to play the
 want to watch because it kind of has everything in it and as a movie I think for me I personally it's the best one and it just ties everything together so I think you can watch this movie if you haven't watch it the 5 if you have watch it the 5
 very first one was like the start of zombies coming back into kind of the movie making. I think they had a little bit
 Not for me, because I was just, I mean, the movie, The Press is all on Meal and Paul. So for me, I was just kind of doing my thing and just kind of, you know, just being accepted by them, hoping to kind of do a good job. But it's afterwards you realize how important it is to a lot of people.
 to be good. Paul wrote this great script. I think me there's like the action star for me for like the last 15 years and Paul
 They just made me feel very welcome. It's a very chill vibe. It's very intense because we're doing these crazy sequences and it's a crazy big set and they make it really chill. And Paul and Mila have their daughter ever in the movies well and Ali's been there for a while so it's a very nice
 They did stick up a couple of the crew with guns. I didn't want to meet any of the people who lived there.
 He has this great way whereby he's doing these incredibly huge sequences. He's got this whole movie mapped out in his head and he just makes it very chill. I never saw him once get stressed. He just makes the whole thing very easy.
 it almost feels like because what we're doing was so hectic and so nuts in terms of the scope for it to be so enjoyable and relaxed almost seems like we're
 ended up, you know, with TC being suspended. So, coming back in the season two, he's still suspended the start
 to being brought it back into the hospital. He's also everyone's aware they had a breakdown. And he ended up talking about a lot of his issues and going through and trying to deal a lot with Jordan.
 look after other people's himself, which is his way of dealing with his own demons and exercising what's happened to him in the past.
 He's very complex because there's also darkness to him, which I think is what people connect to because everyone's got that kind of darkness.
 to, uh, he's trying hard to deal with that and the cope with all these things have happened to him from being in Afghanistan with his brother. And that's hard. And I think that's, he's a very human character and he's, uh,
 I think all the characters really are really identifiable because they're all real people. It's the way that they've kind of created the characters, like Drew and Rogoset and Tofe, that they're real people that kind of you care about.
 It's always much easier when you come back to the second season because you know everybody and so you can kind of mess around with people more and you understand their foibles. Now everyone is a different way
 and you get each other because then you don't even have to act anymore after time because you just feel like talking to your friends.
 fabricating something it's like we understand each other we know who we are and everyone knows who the characters are so no one's ever just kind of falling
 fun right but it's fun but there's also a lot of kind of humor to it but then it's quite energetic and which I think is really important and it's quite real and all the characters
 sucked into something too dramatic all the time and that's kind of lightened a little bit and it goes down again. There's a lot of intensity to it. So there's a lot of kind of energy with it and I think that's the fun thing about this show is because it's always got a good pace to it and that's what makes
 I thought I knew a little bit, but all these books to learn. But we do some really, really, really interesting stuff, like doing akmos and all these things.
 So I got people like John Fong and he's worked in the AR for years. So you do learn about a lot of stuff they wouldn't know about otherwise, which is
 the movie was an initiation to be honest with you. The very first day they threw me on set and we had this big, you know, three-page scene and it's, you know, we're in this massive set and there's guns and I had to do all the dialogue and me, and we had to kind of get really
 great stung guy called Nathan Barras, who's fantastic and did all like a lot of the South African shows such as Dominion and stuff. So he was really on top of it, but they let me do
 are the cool stuff like coming down off the gradings and off
 and stuff. And yeah, he was, uh, all the, most of, unless it came, like, very, very, very fine detail stuff, they let me do a lot of it. But Nathan was great because he oversaw it.
 kind of think I really want to do these stunts and they probably won't let me do it. And then you realize, oh, there's two other people who, if I break my finger or myself, we have to change the scene. So it's not about, you know,
 I mean, she's beautiful, right? I mean, I remember, I mean, when you see me then, fifth element.
 original Resident Evil. She's beautiful and she's still beautiful and she's just the most wonderful person. She's a wonderful actress and I just I adore
 creates that vibe on set where she makes it, you know, everythings.
 I don't get too much. I kind of usually get it when I'm actually going through going through our poor security or going through immigration in America.
 And I used to get really worried going through Immigration America because you guys make it all very, very serious.
 I was texting some of my buddies and I told them I was going to be playing Ellie Gardner's love interest and they were quite jealous.
 Back on Night Shift, we started about two months. I'm doing a movie with a buddy of mine in about three weeks.
 There's only some editing at this top in the tail of the film. The rest of it is all shot sequentially from start to finish.
 analysis to me. I think every time we are in a direct, we have
 explore that, you don't have to worry about other things and then because you understand each other's actors, I know a director
 doing it sequentially allowed people to be free and then see where their characters are going. It wouldn't have worked.
 That's the kind of height of what man can do to the man and then I want to see
 That was like what you're saying about keeping it sequential so I wanted to just get real reactions everything was very real so because we didn't I didn't like I don't really like to do
 dislike for what has happened and for himself, he does not care for TC most important.
 needs to have an outlet to focus on. I think even though Benning may be because he is spending so much time looking after other people, he actually needs to be able to.
 and I can imagine it'd be very, doing it in real life, working for 12 to 14 hours, it would be stressful.
 following certain regulations is frustrating for him because it takes time and it doesn't like.
 a small group of rebels who are kind of just about barely surviving in a cone city and they're exhausted and there's a lot of inner fighting and little factions developing and he's just about keeping together and along with Claire Redfield and he's the two of them are romantically intertwined and they're kind of just about surviving. And Doc is, when me or Alice turn
 Yeah, well, you know, I think he kind of doc looks he's he's reluctant leader and that he's looking after everybody but at the same time is
 It was quite humbling. Dan ever made me feel very, very special and a really nice time. It was a really nice group of people. And I think that's important to do a movie that's kind of, that's this important. It's the last one to franchise and it's this big. You kind of want to work with people
 And so, you know, you're working long hours, and it's difficult and it's tough, but if you get on with people, you know.
 like we're going to do this and you go that's you know they're better at it than I am but if you can get away with it
 old or 14 years old, that's kind of what being an actor is in your head, right?
 or these actors from South Africa who are made up as these zombies. And they, when you have a crowd of group of people at night times surrounded by fire and they're all done up as zombies and their whole mandate is to try and kill
 You know, that can become a little bit freaky because it coming at you through the grading.
 just really let him spy by time with man my Charlie because he worked really hard and inspired by my mom for what she does now she works hard with my sisters everybody you know by my granny
 Last question in the about you section. Have you ever had any funny encounters with fans?
 Quick, from all the places you went to, what was your favorite place to shoot and why?
 I think if my most actors, if when you deal with character, you know, part of it becomes you.
 Are you going to be directing, starring in any more movies or projects in the near future?
 Will you be reprising your role as Grain in Season 5? This question is from Lucy Wood.
 Great, great, that's wonderful. I cannot wait, wait, for what? Great, I for one I cannot wait.
 I'm quite glad about that personally, I'm quite glad. Next question, do you like to travel and have you ever gone to any exotic places from Eleanor?
 that that was a big accident shooting at night time, which is, you know what, I thought in New Mexico was going to be hot. This is cold. This is like as bad
 who was the business on the purpose of the hospital.
 Katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan, että katsotaan,
 that motivating factor, which kind of starts a lot of the clash between the two of them. And then Jordan is kind of the counterpoint between all that.
 Do you have to treat as a business or what? That's the fundamental core of this episode.
 in combat situations and dealing with life and death situations. If you got somebody in a suit telling you what to do, you don't want to listen to that. You don't listen to anybody in a suit telling you what to do, anybody. So that's the fundamental reason why they don't get on. And then Rogosa is telling T.C. what to do and T.C. doesn't agree with them. Because for T.C. it's about saving lives and the hell would everything else. What Rogosa has to treat it
 Because Jordan is there and she's engaged and so you got the whole ex-girlfriend boyfriend type thing or not and they clash a lot but they still carry by each other
 late at night, you're going to get everything right because you're going to get all gunshot victims, you're going to get people in high-intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at night time, right? I mean that's realistically when you get a lot of bad accidents, people are tired, you've got drunk drivers, you've got all that stuff and you're also going to get the drive, you're going to get the drives to society all the way to the top. It's going to be I think a whole vast spectrum but it's all the, I think it's some of the
 The characters have to approach it the same way, because life is too short. I think if you see people are dying in front of you, you've got to find the humor in it. Eventually, you've got to find the humor in everything else around you. Otherwise, life's too more venomous.
 place and pull, shoot some hope and just, you know, chill out and just get away from everything.
 You can see all these heart and lungs in John does this great job by this is perfect replicas of like an open heart surgery of like someone's spine and so that's really cool. You see like all this kind of weird jam.
 The nice thing, it's essentially, it's kind of like mash meets E.I. I guess, an auspicesk. It's a more high-octane version of it, of a doctor's show. It's not like anything I ever watched.
 It's very different because you're dealing an awful lot with the night shift which has got very different type of scenarios and you would have in the day shift of a hospital which I wasn't aware of that so I did it.
 So it's got this great mixture of drama,
 and so forth, married to this kind of argument.
 I'm in a situation because you have all, you know, they're all ready to be army. And so in that situation is a nice bit of comedy to it, like my action is a lot of
 And I play a character called TC Callahan, who is an ex-army medic who is in Afghanistan with...
 TC, you know, he suffered an awful lot from when he was.
 So TC is suffering off a lot from having been in Afghanistan and now he's working in the ER and the reason why he works in the ER and the night shift is because he still gives him that
 Dude, who's very quick to anger, but he's a very, very, very smart doctor. But he just does not like being told what to do. So he likes doing things his own way.
 The character of TC is someone who's been in the army but has always been a difficult to follow orders directly so he's always tried to do his own thing and not actually led to him being being
 out of the army, essentially, because he wasn't always following direct orders. So in the ER, TC is a little bit of a maverick in terms of the understands that to do things, and he doesn't usually wait to be told what to do, we'll just do it.
 Well, but TC is always the one who kind of go out and kind of, um, and tofer. They're the ones who go out into the environment too. We're the rescue helicopter to bring people in and they leave the ER and awful lot to kind of bring in patients who are in trouble and so forth. They do, they don't just stay in
 Yeah, I think pretty much every episode so far there's there's a big event and that's what's
 interesting. There's a lot of intensity and a lot of high octane drama going on but it's still got this lovely sense of pace and it's nice.
 and her mom was actually, but after she actually was teaching a pre-nursing module.
 I had to go over her course and my dad was sick for three or four months. So I've actually taught this stuff.
 not the unusual day shift type stuff, but also because of the scenarios it can create with
 to the army and so forth, and everything that goes on at nighttime. It's like that whole idea that, you know, there's a full moon where stuff happens, right? So at nighttime, weirdest stuff seems to happen in hospital, because that's when all the crazies come in. So it's already got that extra element of craziness attached to it, and you get all this stuff with the army, which is a very interesting dynamic, and you've got these army doctors. So everything is more intense, and they kind of dealt with death in a different level.
 It's also quite, it's like mash, you know what I mean? And mash has been around for a long time. So it's got that comedy with a lot of drama with a lot of action. So there's a lot of things
 The show's not really like Raisin' Adaminear because, do you remember the show, Mash, from the 80s? I love Mash, right?
 Do you remember the show Mash from the 80s? I love Mash, right? And this shows more is more kind of associated with that because we got the kind of military aspect. There's also a lot of kind of black humor in our show, which is different. So Grey's Anatomy and NEO are great shows, but they're more dramatic. And ours has the drama, but it's got these different elements. So it's actually quite different.
 The interesting thing is because he's always on the edge because he's been to war and he suffers from pizza.
 on a real guy, a real character and then we have a lot of military people working with the show and it's a military hospital and so all the cases are stuff that actually happens and I think that's what also makes the show interesting
 kind of element to it in terms of all the cases and hyper realism I think it's
 Did you say it is a bit chaotic and a bit action? That's why it's fun. We have two doctors who work in the set all the time.
 and my aunt is a doctor so I spent some time with them and I bought loads of books about loads of books and I didn't read them but I have them there so it makes me feel
 And I think it's interesting whether that medicine looking after somebody does become an actual business and takes away from the amount of human aspect of it. And that's kind of what the two fight against, because TC just wants to save people and doesn't really care about business and authority and all that kind of stuff. And Jordan does. And she needs to look after the actual paperwork and the business aspect of it, because otherwise the hospital will not work. And then it doesn't work.
 He kind of does his own thing, which is incredibly attractive to play as a character.
 and it's incredibly attractive to watch because you're watching someone which is, I think it makes you comfortable to watch somebody who doesn't really care because you don't kind of worry about them.
 It feeds his own feelings of guilt, so he has to. Every single person that comes into
 saving somebody's life because it was almost like saving your own life. It's almost like saving part of his past because of the things that happened to him.
 you know somebody who is so how bent on doing the right thing and so how bent on helping someone else or they're just incredibly certain about what they want to do that you automatically want to support them and that's what it is.
 and Alexander, and that is a very destructible nature. But any more so for Jordan than the ones for T.C. I think actually for T.C.
 make a lot of his friction and problems and so forth.
 And I've heard from a lot of people, friends of mine, that you don't often get that. And the same is on this show that we just happen to have this really great group of people who are by everyone. And the way they cast and put together is really interesting because
 Yeah, I think so. I think it helps. I think the most important thing I think with acting is that you trust the other person.
 from curfew and Danny was the guy who when I decided
 and about acting and so forth when I was studying, so I was studying my life. And then me and myself and Danny started making fun of me.
 we are on screen which is really weird because Ken is very, Ken is very zen and he's got this
 to act with this character, which has been given to me by virtue of what the character is.
 I think just a few people know I am, but everyone's really sweet. And everyone's like, you know, it's nice from people actually.
 I don't do a lot of post-production, make sure it's all perfect, but it only takes a bit of a year, I think.
 It's a very kind of a very surreal place. I mean, I was there recently for about two or three months. I kind of really enjoyed it. I'm a lot of very interesting people, but it's kind of...
 Because everyone's in this kind of very, very concerted bubble of kind of, and it's just all about kind of acting and all that kind of getting there and being on TV and being on film.
 To be honest, I actually was very lucky and I actually met somebody in London who actually was in LA and I went over down to meet them. And then I was kind of who I was actually in the spirit of one of the things that I would go for two weeks if I meet somebody great. And then I just did and then I met an management company, met an agent and then I just
 and some stuff I've done. I've just done studs, I had a few bits and pieces and I did a few more logs for them and then they come
 watching Owen Wilson about before the wedding crashes and he doesn't actually like Owen Wilson and he tell Owen Wilson was
 and then kind of in Avisso and Mark Wahlberg. So he's kind of, he knows a lot of people and he kind of knows.
 and then, basically, he's very private about eight people of class and then, kind of, he...
 I wouldn't put a time limit on it, but I kind of think it's going to do it as long as I'm enjoying it, non-economy, really interesting people. And kind of means going along quite well, so I mean, if it goes that well.
 Well, I directed a film which I'm kind of in post-production at the moment.
 and just to buy mid-summer next year. But that was a big experience.
 The Jamison film festival. I mean, they're a met them at the end of the day and I have to go to the studs thing. They're great because they're kind of really helpful to people who want to get involved in the film. So the competition and the idea is basically anybody can
 and on any medium any format. And basically you got to submit a 60 second advertisement for
 The idea is, if the winner, which I think the entries are going to be in by 24th January, and the winner gets 3,000 euros, plus gets a film shown in the film festival, and then also I think they may be transcribed on to 35 minutes.
 shooting straight after Christmas, some stuff with Jay and then I got to do a few pickups and possession and then I
 see all the big parts and everything, you have to audition for it and usually you might do a tape and then you go to
 I kind of fit in properly because I love the movies and I love the computer games, so I want to do justice. But it was Paul Amina made it very easy. Paul gave me the room and the space to explore the character they wanted to and work with Meola.
 So it just makes everything nice and simple. So there's no, it was very calm. It's a very intense shooting schedule, a very intense set, but it's very calm.
 do that much CGI. I think the vast majority, well I mean there's obviously a bit in terms of enhancing stuff but the vast majority was Paul wanted to go back to shooting the way you would with everything in camera. So he had all these kind of really crazy locations like this. If you remember the really
 That's all, that's not a set. That's all this big building in Johannesburg.
 three stories away and none of that CGI and all the sets they built or not the built they would find these video buildings, rack them and then kind of create the set in there. So a lot of it is just
 And that's again I've still got this memory which which won't leave me which is because when I played the
 the bloody house and you have to open doors and then some jumpsay and you just don't want to and even when you know you have to
 And you just don't want to. And even when you know you have to open the door and you know what the thing is gonna come from it just still gets you every time. So that was my very first memory of Resident Evil.
 He gave me a lot of scope to kind of, I mean, Paul had very, very interesting ideas at this character anyway, so it was kind of easy for me to come in and go cool. He knew what he wanted from the character.
 But he allowed me the freedom to kind of just play with stuff and he trusted me because we shot a lot of it sequentially. So it was like, okay, we're going to, this is where I want the character to go to the end. So he had to kind of trust me to let me play it that way until we got to that part.
 So they sent a telegram to Spain. Same from now on, we want Captain Hans Didrich to have an eye patch.
 You have to look at people, at normal people, who were swayed to go along with that

 The reality in North Africa was that Rommel fought with a small group against an entire British 8th Army and beat the crap out of most of them, most of the time. That was the reality. Rapper George turned that around. People often ask me, what do you think about it?

 We badly need taxes. When you go to Amsterdam, for example, you go to where the stoner's hangout in Amsterdam, you almost never see a fight break out. If you go to the bars in England, in the sculptor in Germany, fights break out all the time.

 Scania was one of the restaurants in town at the time, on Sunset Boulevard. And the corner agency, the Paul Cone agency, is diagonally across. So they came to lunch there sometimes. So I got to talking to Walter Coneau, who came with a scarm about that.

 I was an hour and a half late. I was in the first scenes. So I remember coming finally to the gate.
 This is weird. So now I come onto the set, cameras and all that had never seen any of that before in my life.
 So the director came, I forget the director's name. And he said, you know, when Werner comes out, he walks up here and you walk this way, then you meet at the

 I think I still have a shot. I think the invitation is still open, so we'll see if I take it or not.
 dedicated to isolating Mark Sloan at the end of the season and leaving him with just himself.
 I personally love Katie. We have a great work.
 Well, yeah, I mean, it's hard to talk about a show like this and not give too much away. But basically, the future of America, and this I know this is hard to buy.
 The last minute before they die yeah take over their body like jumping into a car before it was off a cliff and then we live their lives and it's it's a one-way ticket. We're not going back to the future

 It's a crime-solving show and I think it's going to be a great fit on Alibi.

 Clearly, very welcoming, I can't think of another set that I'd rather be on at this point.
 I'm going to show like this. Any of the lawn orders, sometimes the guests start to get the greatest stuff to do because they got to solve the crimes. We get to commit them.
 all of them. These two characters in particular have had the most from what I've seen.
 and Chris' characters. We've met the other people on their lives. We've seen their pain. So when they have an episode where it's more about the guest stars, we still know their back stories. And I think it helps to make them mad.
 I think what makes television shows last a long time is chemistry. I mean, the scripts can be great. If you're not really jiving, the love can only go so far. I think people really dig for some risk together. I think women are obviously attracted to him, but they're really attracted to her as a role model. And I think that the nature of these stories
 just solving the crime. The crime gets us in the gut every time because it is about victims, it is about women, almost always, and we all have sisters and mothers.
 The casting is everything, camaraderie is everything. You can have great writing that never gets realized if there isn't a gel.
 in the casting process was amazing, because to make a character like Daniel palatable, you've got to understand what others can see in him. And she's such an empathetic character. It's a beautiful girl.
 And she and I have just connected and that can be that can be tough. You don't connect with your with your leading lady when you're solving crimes. They've been long days, but she's so great and then bringing Scott Wolf onto the show. RJ Smith and LaVar Burton is just a lovely lower group of people. There isn't a bad egg and I think that

 Well, I have to carry the way to the gay community on a sitcom.

 I love playing somebody smarter than me. I love throwing big words around.
 And he loves it. That's the thing. He's a teacher, and he's a scientist, and he loves kind of wielding that intelligence around. And of course, the irony being that because he's schizophrenic, his brain can turn on him at any moment.
 in me, which is great. I mean, when we shot the pilot, which was actually a couple of years ago, now it's going back to 2010, but I did a lot of research. I wanted to make sure that I got it right right out of the gate because it matters, because I wanted the mental health community to respect the show and embrace

 My favorite is the show begins and ends most episodes with lectures.
 It takes me all the way back to, you might remember this to the paper chase in the 70s, which I just love doing.
 And the lectures are fun. He's like the professor you wish you had. He's like that guy.
 what he does, and funny, and a little sexy, I hope. And these kind of bookend the show and give it a different feel. And it's interesting, but it's so rewarding.
 There's always tomorrow. You can never take it for granted that this is going to last forever as an actor, even in a successful show. They come and go. And you've got to keep inventing yourself and keep looking forward and remember that this could all disappear. And first and foremost, comes your family.
 He hadn't, because he was a general practitioner. He was a doctor.
 Good to be an actor. It was looked down upon, and I think he just kept it a secret. He hid behind his doctor in this, but secretly he snapped down.

 Well, for me, Canada Day is also my son's birthday. He was born in the States. He's American-born, but on Canada Day. So we're usually up there, my wife and son are up there right now in Canada, in our house in Vancouver, with the fireworks and the barbecue. You know, very much the same as here. But I missed it because I mean, I'm still in New York finishing up a show on
 We were doing a very, very funny bit, written by Will and Grace Writers, and Will and Grace, essentially, Deb and I were doing our characters, and we had a very funny bit about how, you know, the Trevor Project is about how

 And in the midst of it, he's a guy that is hence the title of the show. He is perceiving the world in such a way that it makes him an interesting detail.
 Is the guy that keeps Daniel Pierce?

 He appeared to be his teacher's aide and his sort of assistant, but he's a lot more than that.
 He keeps Daniel grounded and does my wife do the same. Yes, in fact, it's probably the opposite. I probably drive my wife.
 Oh, it almost sounds easy to say from someone that has had a chance to achieve these things.
 don't, don't give up. I mean, I just, I can't imagine my life if I had questioned. There was a lot of people
 That was a nice suggestion, but for me, it was going full throttle and never doubting.

 But six years ago, it's getting to be typecasting now.

 He's okay with that. I asked him to put himself on tape for a friend of mine who was turning 50.
 It was a woman, but I don't think he heard that part. And I said, just say whatever you want, just say happy.

 I've ever really loved and I probably really loved about half a dozen of them.
 But she's married to it, you know, for a real reason. You're not just because she wrote it. No, she has real reasons. And if you listen to her, she probably is the most intelligent woman I've ever been in a room with, with the exception of my wife.

 No, I wanted to be a cop first, I knew your cop. At 17 I changed my mind and then I got, because I got bit by the acting bug and the drama and

 And what happens is that they can't produce that part. They don't make it anymore. It's discontinued. It comes at time in the movie where he has to go into this bridge and then he's got to power up to go straight up.
 And he meets those challenges, but at the same time puts himself in jeopardy, like firefighters do every day, front line. Because if he goes to a certain level of speed, he could blow up, he could burst

 You get up, dust yourself off, and move forward. Go and do your dream. Get it done. You can do it. You can do it. There's always the opportunity for a second chance. If it doesn't present itself, you make the opportunity of a second chance for yourself. That's what the movie teaches.

 I am curious what are you doing because that's kind of we were trying to match you and we were not really getting feedback. Are you dressing your

 So I said we need you, you know, and we'd like to have you as soon as possible.
 And I said, I don't really want to get back in the television anymore because, you know, I like motion pictures. Okay. But if you change your mind, let me know. Next morning, knock, knock, knock on the door, there was a young man selling chocolate bars for some high school out there.
 And he said, would you like them? Sure, sure. Okay. So he reached a region for the money and he said, Mr. you look awfully familiar. What's your name?
 He does gun smoke. I said, no, no, no. I said, my name is really Richard Boone. I said, no, he does have gun will travel. I said, son of a gun, this kid really knows them all. I'll get him now.
 Thank you very much. Put down the chocolate bars, call the agent.
 and talk over at the Washington Press Club. I was quite out of it.
 And he said, listen, there's a whole group of girl scout that came by and taking the picture and everything else. Would you mind taking a picture with them? I said, no, not at all. So we walked over. And these girls have given a whole truckload of cookies and sent them over to a rack for the boys, next to them. Marvelous, you know. And do you know who I am?
 No answer. Have you any of you ever seen my pictures?
 I took the bull by the horns. I said, have any of you ever seen SpongeBob?

Evidently it all fell through, nothing happened but still made seven against the sea and one day
 And he took a bunch of sailors and went out into the desert.
 I believe so, and they were supposed to send back, you know, the weather reports from this African and all the stuff that they get into with the Arabs over there and everything else. I never saw the picture, but, you know, this man said, hey, why not put this fella with a bunch of fellas with a PT boat over on it, Ireland, and do this.
 And they said, we'd like you to do, you know, you know, we love the water and space.
 Yeah, he had been nice, but I said no, no, no, I'm a motion picture actor now, you know. I can't, I don't do television anymore.
 So, well, if you change your mind, please, you know, we want to get started as soon as possible. Let us know.
 Young man came to the door the next morning selling chocolate pies for some school and wanted to put up a building or something.
 And he said, would you like that? Sure. I said, how much are they? And I said, digging for the money. He said, Mr. you look awfully familiar. What's your name? I said, my name is James Arnes. I said, no, no, he does gun smoke. I said, no, my name is really Richard Boone. No, he does have gun will travel. I said,
 I said I'll tell him my name and I'm sure he'll know. My name is Ernest
 He said, I know. I've seen you somewhere. I said, thank you, son. Here's your money. Thank you very much. Took my chocolate bars with inside. Called up my agent. I said, that part's still open. And he said, yes.
 and after we had done the kill, I'm way up in Oregon looking for some place to stay for the night
 and I opened the door to this cottage at an office.

 but it keeps everything together. Well, okay, McCale, my Navy. So I got all the fellas together and I said, listen, I'll tell you something, fellas. The more fun we have doing this, the more the people are going to enjoy it. And if we really
 You know, because we do our work, boom, bam, bam, and all, we'd have at least 12 pages of dialogue
 and action. In the can, by no time, believe it or not, we were good. We were good. And there was that time we spent around playing and on everything else. Of course, we didn't do it in front of the producer.
 But he used to set up there with us, always working, you know. He tried to direct us a few times, but it was so hard for him. He finally decided, thank God, let's
 you make it so that people laugh. And this is, it's so easy. I don't know.

 Well, are you one of those, what are they used to call Marlon Brando, that school of acting?
 I said, what we're doing right now, just talking between each other, we're acting. This is what acting is all about. We are acting to which you're listening to me and I'm listening to you. And I answer you in kind, so I'm back and forth.
 No, no, no, no. They couldn't believe it. I said, well, what else would you do?
 You're right. You're right. That's what I think is all about, because it comes from here.
 over these things, and I love reading between the lines.
 My personage, but I the personage of this character that the writer wrote about
 and so I go over each and every line. Do I understand
 Does that line make sense to me? Why would I say that line if I, you know, if I wanted to say something else, what would I say in its state?
 And all these things I've taken to consideration as we're going along, reading and studying, because I always feel that somewhere out there,
 And you see, what do you say? What do you say? You've lost them. You've lost them because
 sense to you, yet you had to say it because, and I say,
 That's no good. So you break down the word. You look up and something that pertains to that word. And you ask the writer about it naturally and say, oh, yes, yes, I should have thought of that myself. But you know, you work it out. And then the first thing, you know, those thumb suckers are satisfied. And I said, Kelly, that was a good play. That was a good show. Why? Because he believed it.
 Not the words of the play, but he believed what you were saying.
 and I are still buddies, still friends. We now work, believe it or not, as voices. SpongeBob, I play Mermaid
 And we met at the first time we did it.
 When you see Tim Conway, you look at him and you say,

 What was I saying? How could I put it without really
 felt that he was teaching. I always told him, I said, you know, I just did something here that I could never have imagined in my mind, thanks to you. And he said, well, thank you very much.
 And we went on to do a number of things together.
 And I remember when we did Marty together as a motion picture,
 I said, well, here we are back again, except we're now, we've got the big screen. He said, yeah, and it was his very
 What happened? I was making a picture called Vera Cruz down in Mexico with Gary Cooper and Bert Lancaster and all.
 and Delbert came down to get a few ideas of how to shoot outside, because he had always been used to a studio.
 He wanted to get some kind of clueless to what to do outside and everything else. So he had Bob Aldrich as his teacher.
 Look at the script. Marty said no, not at all. So he read the script in a couple of weeks later at a party
 He just goes around killing people. That's all he does in his pictures. You know, stabs him to death and do that. No, I said, don't kid yourself. He said, this guy could do it.
 So they said, OK, we'll take a chance. So they called me in.
 And they said, we've got a fight for you in a picture called Marty. Is it fine? That's wonderful. I'd be very glad to play any place so you don't understand this. So we want you to play the role of Marty
 I said that I'll give you 120%. Thank you very much. So now when you're making this picture, I'd like to go right up to a Lone Pine california, making then that day at Black Rock with Spencer Tracy.
 They said, Delbert Mann and Patty Chaevsky are going to come up and have you read for them. Okay, fine. You know, you read. Good. Well, make a long story short. I was leaving the cast of Bad Dead Black Rock one day.
 And Spencer looked at me and he said, where are you going? He said, if anybody leaves here early, he says, me, I'm sorry.
 What's it all about? I told him a story and he said she sounds pretty
 I tell you, that's all right. Oh, don't worry about it. He said, you go on. You get it. Don't worry.
 And Patty was sitting along. They'd just come up in an airplane, little plane bouncing all over these mountains. You're not going up the lone pine.
 Make a long story short. Hi fellas. How are you? Hello. Hello. Good to see you. Tell a bit wonderful to see you, sir. All right. And I went in to kind of washed up a little bit.
 And so I said, well, you know where he said, we even talked and said, we feel that he got to the word but.
 and his excuse. I said, sir, I said, believe me, if you feel that I'm not right for the point.
 You know, I'll help you find somebody because I said I feel quite strongly about this. I feel that, you know, this could be a heck of a great motion picture.
 instantly I forgot that my first six lessons are acting that I had learned it very badly.
 Forgive me, you know. I went over through my hat down.
 took my boots off and rolled up my sleeves and everything else.

 And I looked at Delbutton, he was crying and inwardly I said, God, I've got to put
 It was the best performance of my life that day to try to prove to those two men that I could do it. I went back the next morning, Spencer looked up.

 have you ever thought of becoming an actor? See, you always like to make a damn fool of yourself in front of people. Why don't you give it a try?
 And I looked up and I saw that golden light come down and I said, Mom, that's what I'm going to be.
 May, after coming back from Italy, having made some pictures over there, my agent called and said,
 And it's fashioned after a picture that was made out in the Sahara Desert, supposedly with Lieutenant Commander takes a whole bunch of sailors out to the Sahara Desert to send back weather reports to the

 I don't want to do television very much anymore. Well, he laughed, and he said, OK, said, but if you change your mind, let me know.
 came to my door the following morning, and his cell and chocolate bars for some school
 He said, you know, you look awfully familiar. I said, really? He said, well, what you know?
 Oh, no, no, no, he does gun smoke. I said, no, my name is really Richard Boone. No, he does have gun wheel traps.
 I said, boy, this kid's pretty smart. But I'll tell him my name, and now he'll know, and all he's got to do is look in the next day.
 So, well, thank you very much, son. Here's your money. Okay, bye-bye.
 I put down the chocolate bars and went to the telephone, called my agent. I said, that part's still open. He said, yes. And he said, I said, OK, I'll do it. He said, what changed your mind? I said, none of your damn business.
 And there was a time in the Navy. We had a Navy lieutenant who used to come in and at the very first
 But I thought you were shooting the United States. No, no, no, this is Macayles Navy, not the United States.
 Well, one day I get a call a couple of years later to go to

 I loved the comedy end of it, and to me to keep a straight face sometimes when we were working was just so hard, because believe me, you know, get right in there, you know, and it was just marvelous.
 We had people coming down on the trams, you know. We'd pop up out of the bushes with spears and everything else, and oh my God, my God, maybe over there. One woman fell out of the tram one day.
 So it was really something. But again, I say, I love cars.
 That's, it shows, I think, in Macayles.
 at the press club in Washington, which is quite prestigious. You know, and I said, what do I want me to say? And this fella taken like anemia from the stories I told. He said, you know, you just come in and just say what you're saying to me right now and just tell him stories.
 So I went in and I did my thing, you know. When I finished the thing, everybody politely, you know, applauded and it was very good.
 out there that brought a lot of cookies for the boys in Iraq. Would you mind saying hello? Don't at all. So I walked out there as I'm walking
 this lady is saying and you know this man has made a lot of pictures and done this and done that and
 He's great. And I said, how many of you have seen my pictures? They all looked at me.
 Suddenly, I had a brainstorm. I said, how many of you know SpongeBob? Yes! I said, well, I happen to play
 pictures they couldn't get enough of me. And then of course I had to give them the even

 And I said, no, I said, what are you going to do? How can we possibly do it?
 Go here. Go there. Do this. Do that.

 And Jamaica, somewhere like that, they had invited a whole bunch of critics from all around the world.
 And next morning after the picture would be a symposium of asking why was this, why was that? And the very first question out of the box after they had seen the wildbunch was, why was this picture ever made?
 Now we were all sitting up there. Sam Peck and Paul, myself, Bill Holden, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson.
 and we thought it was an excellent picture. And they said there are shots to blood, this, that

 When I was a youngster, my mother used to go on a shopping on Saturday.
 And she'd say, all right, now you do it and you do it right or else. You don't go to the movies. I got a big dime to go to the movies.
 And many times she came back and I worked my tail off, you know, trying to...

 I had the opportunity of going back to Italy with her when she separated from my dad when I was just a boy and two years of age as a matter of fact and at that time he was feeling his oats and one of the kicks

 I joined the Navy in 1935 after high school.
 I was working on a vegetable truck for $3 a week. And of course, it was depression in those days.
 I saw a sign that said, join the name, you see the world. I said, boy, they said, you know, I can make some money at the same time.
 So I joined the Navy and I was one of 12 that made it out of about 1,200 people that were waiting to go into the service.
 This came out in 1941, decided to go home and see what it was all about then. And then three weeks later, or three months later, the war started, the World War II.
 As a matter of fact, I was put on a yacht. It was one of three ships guarding the entire Atlantic coast at that time. There were three yachts. The South, the Sapphire, and the Zircon. And I was onboard the South. I had my own private state room.
 Captain didn't they didn't know any better, no days. The captain used to knock on my door. Who is it?
 and we had, we without one time and almost caught a submarine, almost.
 I was the gunners made a board ship and we had a wide gun because the ship didn't go fast enough to roll the cans off the stern.
 Well, make a long story short. The captain called me and said, we got a submarine, did the rights. And he said, when it said the cans at 75 feet and so on and so forth, and when I blow the bell, blow the whistle, let it rip.
 And they're watching this stuff go over and I'm kicking him in the back. Come on, come on, get up, load it up, load it up. And I'm listening for the detonation of the other ones. We knocked off about ten of them. Not a one went off.
 Well, we came back in the port. They started to take off the rest of the debt charges. I said, wait a minute, you've got a full minute of mercury in there and everything else. Oh, don't worry, I said, you've got a chip in there.
 I got a chip in Hammond. It chipped off a little tiny thing about this big. And it said manufactured in the 1970s.
 And I think we've got a good film for you. Hallmark always comes out with some good stuff and believe me, I'm very happy to be in this one. It's about an old grandpa who has kind of given up on Christmases and everything else simply because his wife had left him and taken a young child with him.
 I tell you, working with Juliet was just marvelous. She hasn't got that method style or anything else. It comes right from the heart. And that's what I love. And you work from the heart and the head. That's what a lot of young actors, these days, don't know what it's all about. They're walking off the street and they're

 And there are so many others that are with us. And we had a wonderful director, Harvey Frost.
 We had a whole picture in four weeks time, boom, bam, bam, and there it is, a grandpa for Christmas. And I enjoyed it. When I first saw it, I really did. I enjoyed it very much.
 believe me, it's my pleasure. And listen, listen.
 But I tell you, after that long trip, coming in all the way
 That's the best thing you can possibly do. Be nice to people and they'll be nice to you.

 But Johnny was Johnny and I'll never forget how I got on to be
 a clown one time. He said to me, Ernie said, what have you been up to? And I said, oh, I've been doing this, that, and the other thing I was on to promote some picture, I guess.
 And he said, you know, he said, you've done just about everything there is to do what's left. I said, oh, lots of things. And he, you know, pinning me down said, like what?
 There's a fellow back there in Milwaukee, and he called me up the next day and said you want to be a clown? We got the best thing in the world for you. Oh my goodness, come on. You got to come here. You got to do it. We're going to have you as a clown. I said, okay, I'll come. You know, I was just about getting ready to do Poseidon Adventure.
 I went and did this clown. I did the clown bid for some 1972 to 2002. And now this next year,
 And they used to bring these wonderful wagons down from Barabu, Wisconsin. These wonderful old wagons that they had, you know, circus wagons. They put them on a train like they had. They sold circus train. They used to pull it.
 And bring them down into Milwaukee. They put them out there in a great big field that they had out there by the water. And then we had a regular circus.
 They have a big circus parade with the elephants and the fans and everything.

 It was almost a wonderful waiting to finish a day to come out and smell the smog out

 That's what most wonderful actor and I can't remember their names now, unfortunately.
 And so she lost about $260,000 to this man.
 But we all had our lives, you know, and we had to make the best of it, and we had a wonderful director.
 I can't remember his name either, but a wonderful British director. And you know, this picture almost didn't become made for the simple reason that there was a new man came in at the 20th century.
 and get to the point where we had to take a shower as you just before walking into the sea, you know, because you had to be wet.

No, we're not going to, you know, no, we
 So everyone went back to his office and he was crying. And the director said, well, what are you crying about?
 And I was, but sorry, so I got all my money tied up and it didn't, you know, oh no, no, that's okay. But now we're not going to make it.
 So everyone went back to his office and he was crying. And the director said, well, what are you crying about?
 Tell me, do you have any whiskey? Here we got whiskey. What do you want whiskey for at a time like that? Let's have a belt. We'll go back and talk.
 We had a belt. They went back and talked to him. Father, this fellow said, all right, he said, you put six million dollars on my table here tomorrow morning as well.
 Now, we've finished the film. And one day we're over at Chasen's, we're having a big party. And he's there, this producer's there, and the head of the

 and people would look at it and the kids would look at it and be all loaded down with guns and everything else.
 the ship itself, oh man, and where did it come from? The inside of a volcano or in or less was marvelous, you know?

 And what is he like? Well, I think he's got kind of a good sense of humor. I think he's kind of a good guy, dad. He's a good dad. He cares very much.

We don't have any rehearsals. So it's always fun.

 and I'm thinking, okay, this I've had them before and it's like, you know, now I've got to, at what point do I do?
 the governor general's wife, that this is what's going on, because at a certain point, if it comes on really strong,
 you're going to be carried out. You won't be able to walk out of the room. So I said, I'm thinking, OK, now it's getting bad, but it wasn't getting worse. So I made it through the whole dinner, didn't need a thing. That was the sad part. It was a good looking dinner.
 and I told her after the dinner and then she was you know she was very fine she said oh well you know we'll we'll find something I said I may need some prescription drugs tonight in Ottawa on its late do you guys have any pull in this

 I just feel good. I mean, I can't honestly, I still don't understand how it happened.

And those were the, that's the first three or four years of my career, kind of doing eight shows a week, which I was really fortunate. And then out of Second City Theatre, we of course
 developed and created our television show, Second City Television, which became SCTV. And, you know, the rest kind of just rolls
 No, I mean, I sort of always knew that I wanted to perform. I didn't quite know in what capacity. And so in high school and college, I was doing a lot of acting stuff and then got my job on MTV, which was more of a hosting situation. And that took about eight years.
 took me away from the acting thing for a while and when I left MTV I got back into it and about a year and a half into that I started working with my dad on this project and then a couple years later here we are.

 to squeeze a stage piece in if we were really strapped for writing.
 And a lot of times they just didn't work as well because they're stage pieces. And of course, when we performed them, we performed them at the same energy level that we would on stage because that's what we were used to doing. They didn't work as well. But the news piece was a great television adaptation because it was TV that we were doing on stage. And when we just put it in the show, it worked pretty well. I mean, we started in show one and went right through

 It was a nice place. Whatever. I don't know what the point is. The point is I enjoyed my house. I don't know whether they're
 Yeah, I could tell you what it was. We had a pool. We had a lovely chat who was living in the guest house. I don't think you really care about that.

 It was amazing. We'd never had production like this in Toronto. It was, you know, great direction, great lighting, great sets. I mean, it really looked dazzling. And once I get up there, I said, whoa.
 You would check off. You're in a bar. You were, you know, this was, we were working our asses up.
 with them was so much energy and enthusiasm that, you know, at this point, around about our second and last season, you know, we were kind of getting tired and it was Marty's energy.
 and just positive vibe and attitude that kind of picked everybody up and now we had to kind of come back up to
 Yes, well, I was 1981 during the kind of Gene Demanian
 of the, just when the original cast had left, right, 1979 or something like that, and the new cast came in, new producer. I did hear that, that they wanted to put us in the Saturday night, 11, 30 time slots.
 Well, I think because they're opposists in some senses because he's someone who's always worried. He's always his brain is always in conflict and that comes across when you read the books. It's sort of, it's almost tiring because he never stops thinking about, he's really conscientious and he has to, like Hermione tells me, as a saving person and he does. Whereas Luna really goes with the flow, you know, she's where everyone's worried about being killed.

 different. It's not like any of the ones before, because they're not Hogwarts anymore. And the sense that it's the seventh book. And this was the big question when the book came out where Harry Lever died. And that's the thing in the film you
 If there's no Dumbledore, the Wiesleys are gone, there's no one to protect them. And you have that sense that there are these teenagers out in the world.
 and how great I can't really get my old pictures in the head. But the ones who I'm friends with, in the book, they're not their characters.

 because she doesn't have any friends. And then when she likes Harry, you know?

 kind of the I don't know no one likes me I'm the very like
 Yeah, I learned to remember that by having that, by not worrying, you saved yourself a lot of trouble.
 they don't do anything. They're trying to protect us from failing, but they actually
 change. She's too much at one with herself that she doesn't need to. So, and people just are always asking, like, how does it be that
 Almost a little bit. I was a little bit for a cycle. Oh, that's a bit, you know, I don't. But I think coming back here, like that was before I came back. I went back here two days ago and saw and met the people who were running it. I'm just, I'm really happy now about this and I'm happy that it's become a studio tour so that it's always going to be there. It's not like packed in boxes and it's not like it never exists.
 It's like leaves, and it's now the home of Harry Potter, which is such a nice thing. And we've also seen some of the people coming through.
 and their reactions are just amazing and so rewarding.
 Yeah, absolutely. Walking through the Great Hall especially there's I remember all the scenes I did with friends and like
 was it and I love those scenes where everyone came back because most of my scenes were either like just with Dan or with the
 up the DA member is six of them and but these ones are always everyone
 I love the Creatureshop and I think it's my favorite in the Creatureshop.
 Phoenix and he's really really beautiful and yeah he just looked
 he's so cool and I just think they've taken all his personality and his interests into account when they built that set.
 I like the Sims a lot. I like some race car games.
 in turn, by the fantasy and the world that J.K. Rowling created.
 No, you know, yeah, I found to see world that we don't experience that I think it
 it's interesting it's like an escape but it's not that you relate to it and she's created some
 French and at my place but I just think at the moment it's a really good time to
 The whole film is just towards this battle, it's really big.
 The special effects work really well with this and the 3D. I was a bit skeptical about the 3D effects, but it works really well.
 you'll just see every character kind of get there and get a moment and it's surprising because there is so much to pack in but all the key characters have been there throughout the series.
 she's going to be wherever she's meant to be. And that's what you never see her worried. She's always just quite relaxed. And even the battle scenes, she'll never start solving hysterically.
 only be positive and it's the right way of thinking, like where he gets, doesn't get anyone anywhere.
 And I think she's a very spiritual character. And also the way she sees herself.
 and they don't have all this self-dead or self-angster and thing that some people in our society
 because they believe they're part of nature and they're perfect for that reason and that's the way Luna is and that's why she's always so calm and trusting and so yeah I think fate is a big part. I think Hermione and Jake are on

 I don't have to ask him what was like working with. He's older, better, and I have to use a box and bother about them.
 So yeah, and I remember my meeting with him very very clearly the first time it was at my screen test, so I hadn't even got the part then. So aside from being just terrified, I just like paralyzed my nerves, but actually auditioned.
 I was just like, if that day was to blur and I'm ever coming in, I haven't got my costume on.
 I did, I had two butterflies. We were on stage, we were doing them a live fleeky mug.
 Yeah, it's even worse, you know, because I've had this, not just for the films, I've had it since I was eight. So, I mean, I don't even really know what kind of person I was before I had Harry Potter.
 because it might last up on the Harry Potter tour because the premiere it's really fun but you don't see a lot of your friends it's so big huge and and just lots of people you don't know where
 And it was lovely because it's like I have been feeling quite down about this going out like some after the first
 experience. We're going, yeah, and going through it and that you can talk to someone that say how sad you

 It's made that more clear. Having the park here, like actually going from the little world to the wizarding world and that's why people, everyone sort of wants to
 go into acting if I hadn't been for this. So really push me into this and I'm like, I love it.
 I don't know if it was inside out, but it was more just the child than me coming out and playing. And I didn't know how to approach the character who I was already up to.
 really had a connection with. So that was just kind of, I did something that was
 small scale because I wanted to just explore and I found it
 challenging it was because it wasn't and also because it was
 Your part of your skilled projects is that you have to be so much more responsible, like, aware of yourself. You have to look at it for yourselves, because they don't have the luxury of time to spend

 listen to the audiobooks, the performances by Jim Dale of the American editions of the books, Count West Times. I mean, we're talking about numbers in the
 rehearsals almost as someone who's been in the desert for so long. And Percival Graves, who is a smart man, perceives this and is exploiting it by saying, hey, you in the desert here is water.
 But Graves also needs something from credence. There's a task.
 That seems to be the dynamic of this mutual reliance that then starts to crumble as they both start to realize or to think that the other one does not have what they need.

 David Yates is the antithesis of that image. He is the opposite of all of those qualities.
 Incredibly quiet. He maintains an incredibly quiet set. The focus on the work is really strong. He's very sweet and kind and warm, loving and supportive, but at the same time, he is a director who will challenge you and will accept nothing less than the best and most authentic performance that you're capable of that day.

 I don't know, for me a lot of my material in this film is just conversations between two people. A lot of the other actors has had a lot more to sort of fill in the blanks of in their mind, but I will say that what I did do
 work with the visual effects department was really collaborative and they were always trying to let us know what things would look like and they were watching our performance is also to inform how they were going to make these images.

 And for me, what I guess what I was interested in, or what I'm becoming more and more interested in, is a lot of times in acting we talk about setting intention. So what is your character's motivation in this scene? Which is great and is important. But for me, what I'm becoming more interested in is, instead of intention, paying attention and paying attention to the body.

 I have remained at least partially immersed in that world.
 Even in my most rebellious, adolescent times, I would still retreat.
 You know what I mean? When I heard about this movie's existence, I just wanted to be in it whatever way. Could I never dream there was going to be a role that would be my age and would be so complex?
 So then when I had done an initial audition and went and talked to the venerable conspiracy of David's, that is, Heyman and

 There's something at the root, which has to do with how human beings have this dangerous tendency to separate ourselves from the world and the beings around us.
 With separation, we lose awareness. And with a loss of awareness, we become frightened. And when we're frightened, we often lash out or demonize or target what we're frightened of.
 you know, permeating all culture is this dangerous element of seeing someone else as completely separate from yourself, losing awareness of how those people are different, but at the root always the same, and then demonizing and targeting other people.
